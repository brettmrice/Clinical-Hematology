##  **Overview of Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping in Lymphoma** {-}

*   **Definition:** The use of flow cytometry to identify and characterize lymphoma cells based on their expression of cell surface and intracellular proteins (antigens). It's a powerful tool, but needs to be used in the context of morphology from cytology and histology samples.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Diagnosis of Lymphoma: Helps distinguish lymphoma from reactive lymphoid proliferations and other types of cancer
    *   Classification of Lymphoma: Identifies specific subtypes of lymphoma based on the immunophenotype of the malignant cells
    *   Prognosis: Can provide information about the prognosis (likely outcome) of the disease
    *   Monitoring Treatment Response: Used to assess the effectiveness of treatment and detect minimal residual disease (MRD)
*   **Sample Types:**
    *   Lymph Node Biopsy: The most common sample type; a single cell suspension is prepared from the lymph node tissue
    *   Bone Marrow Aspirate: Used to assess bone marrow involvement in lymphoma
    *   Peripheral Blood: Can be used to evaluate for circulating lymphoma cells (e.g., in SÃ©zary syndrome)
    *   Other Tissue Biopsies: Can be used to evaluate for lymphoma in extranodal sites (e.g., spleen, liver, skin)

##  **Interpreting Flow Cytometry Results** {-}

*   Establish Gating Strategy:
    *   Use forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) to gate on the lymphocyte population
    *   Exclude debris, doublets, and non-lymphoid cells
*   Identify Cell Populations:
    *   Use lineage-specific markers (e.g., CD19 for B cells, CD3 for T cells) to identify different lymphocyte populations
*   Assess Antigen Expression Patterns:
    *   Determine whether the cells express the expected antigens
    *   Identify any aberrant antigen expression patterns (e.g., co-expression of myeloid markers on lymphoid cells)
*   Evaluate Clonality:
    *   Assess for light chain restriction in B-cell populations (kappa or lambda)
    *   Perform T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement studies to assess for T-cell clonality

##  **Reporting Results** {-}

*   Report the percentage of cells expressing each marker
*   Provide an interpretation of the results, noting any abnormal findings

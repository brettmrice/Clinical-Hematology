# Destruction {-}

## **Overview of Thrombocytopenias due to Increased Destruction** {-}

*   **Definition of Thrombocytopenia:** Abnormally low platelet count, defined as a platelet count less than 150 x 10^9/L (150,000/ÂµL)
*   **Clinical Significance:** Increases the risk of bleeding, ranging from minor skin bruising to severe or life-threatening hemorrhages
*   **Major Causes of Thrombocytopenia Due to Increased Destruction (Immune and Non-Immune):**

    *   Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)
    *   Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)
    *   Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)
    *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Consumptive Coagulopathy, may also be due to non-immune consumptive process
    *   Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)
*   **General Laboratory Findings:**
    *   Reduced platelet count.
    *   Normal or increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (in thrombocytopenias due to increased destruction)
    *   Prolonged bleeding time and/or abnormal platelet function tests
    *   Other findings specific to each disorder (see below)

## **Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)** {-}

*   **Definition:** An acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) with normal bone marrow and no other causes of thrombocytopenia
*   **Also Known As:** Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
*   **Types:**
    *   Primary ITP: No identifiable underlying cause
    *   Secondary ITP: Associated with underlying conditions, such as:
        *   Autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE, rheumatoid arthritis)
        *   Infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C, *Helicobacter pylori*)
        *   Lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., CLL)
        *   Medications
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Autoantibody Production: Autoantibodies (typically IgG) are produced against platelet membrane glycoproteins (e.g., GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX)
    *   Platelet Destruction: Antibody-coated platelets are recognized and destroyed by macrophages in the spleen (extravascular hemolysis)
    *   Impaired Platelet Production: Some autoantibodies may also target megakaryocytes, impairing platelet production
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Many patients are asymptomatic
    *   Bleeding Manifestations:
        *   Petechiae (small, pinpoint hemorrhages)
        *   Purpura (bruising)
        *   Nosebleeds (epistaxis)
        *   Gum bleeding
        *   Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual periods)
        *   Gastrointestinal bleeding (less common)
        *   Intracranial hemorrhage (rare but life-threatening)
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC):
        *   Isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 x 10^9/L)
        *   Normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and differential
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Decreased number of platelets
        *   May see large platelets (megathrombocytes), reflecting increased platelet production by the bone marrow
        *   No other significant abnormalities (e.g., schistocytes, blasts)
    *   Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy (Not always necessary; usually performed to rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia):
        *   Normal or increased megakaryocytes (platelet precursors)
        *   Normal cellularity and maturation of other cell lines
    *   Direct Antibody Test (DAT) for Platelets:
        *   Detects the presence of anti-platelet antibodies
        *   Not always performed, as the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are limited
    *   Exclusion of Other Causes of Thrombocytopenia:
        *   Rule out drug-induced thrombocytopenia, TTP, HUS, DIC, and other conditions that can cause thrombocytopenia
*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis of exclusion. ITP is diagnosed when other causes of thrombocytopenia have been ruled out and is supported by normal or increased megakaryocytes in the bone marrow
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Observation: Mild thrombocytopenia in asymptomatic patients may not require immediate treatment
    *   Corticosteroids: Prednisone or dexamethasone
        *   Suppress autoantibody production and decrease platelet destruction
        *   First-line treatment for symptomatic ITP
    *   Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG):
        *   Used to rapidly increase the platelet count in patients with significant bleeding or requiring urgent surgery
        *   Mechanism: Blocks Fc receptors on macrophages, reducing platelet destruction
    *   Anti-D Immunoglobulin (WinRho):
        *   Used in Rh-positive patients with ITP
        *   Mechanism: Antibody-coated RBCs are then cleared by the spleen, "sparing" the platelets from destruction
    *   Rituximab:
        *   Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, reducing autoantibody production
        *   Used in patients who are refractory to corticosteroids and IVIG
    *   Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonists (TPO-RAs):
        *   Eltrombopag and romiplostim
        *   Stimulate platelet production by binding to and activating the thrombopoietin receptor on megakaryocytes
        *   Used in patients who have failed other treatments
    *   Splenectomy:
        *   Surgical removal of the spleen
        *   Used in patients with severe, refractory ITP
        *   Increases the risk of infection with encapsulated organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis)
        *   Patients require vaccination before splenectomy

## **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia
*   **Hallmark:** Pentad of Thrombocytopenia, Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia, Neurologic Abnormalities, Fever, and Renal Abnormalities
*   **Types:**
    *   Acquired TTP:
        *   Autoimmune: Antibodies against ADAMTS13
        *   Idiopathic: No known underlying cause
        *   Secondary: Associated with pregnancy, autoimmune disorders, medications, or stem cell transplantation
    *   Hereditary TTP (Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome):
        *   Inherited deficiency of ADAMTS13
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   ADAMTS13 Deficiency: Reduced or absent activity of ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF)
    *   vWF Multimer Accumulation: Ultra-large vWF multimers accumulate in the microvasculature
    *   Platelet Activation and Microthrombi Formation: vWF multimers bind to platelets, leading to platelet activation, aggregation, and the formation of microthrombi in small blood vessels
    *   Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA): RBCs are damaged as they pass through the microthrombi, resulting in fragmentation (schistocytes) and hemolysis
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Platelets are consumed in the formation of microthrombi
    *   Organ Ischemia: Microthrombi obstruct blood flow to vital organs (brain, kidneys, heart), leading to organ damage
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Bleeding manifestations (petechiae, purpura, etc.)
    *   Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA): Fatigue, pallor, jaundice
    *   Neurologic Abnormalities: Headache, confusion, seizures, stroke
    *   Fever
    *   Renal Abnormalities: Elevated creatinine, hematuria, proteinuria
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 x 10^9/L)
        *   Anemia (decreased HGB and HCT)
        *   Increased reticulocyte count
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Schistocytes (fragmented RBCs)
        *   Polychromasia (increased reticulocytes)
        *   Decreased platelets
    *   Coagulation Studies:
        *   PT and aPTT: Usually normal
        *   Fibrinogen: Normal or slightly increased
        *   D-dimer: May be elevated
    *   Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH): Elevated (due to hemolysis)
    *   Indirect Bilirubin: Elevated (due to hemolysis)
    *   Haptoglobin: Decreased (due to hemolysis)
    *   Creatinine: Elevated (due to renal involvement)
    *   ADAMTS13 Activity Assay:
        *   Markedly reduced (<10% of normal) in most cases of acquired TTP
        *   Absent in hereditary TTP
    *   ADAMTS13 Inhibitor Assay:
        *   Detects the presence of autoantibodies against ADAMTS13
*   **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis of TTP requires prompt recognition and treatment
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Plasma Exchange:
        *   Mainstay of treatment
        *   Removes vWF multimers and replaces ADAMTS13
    *   Corticosteroids:
        *   To suppress autoantibody production
    *   Rituximab:
        *   Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells and reduces autoantibody production
    *   Caplacizumab:
        *   A humanized nanobody that binds to vWF and inhibits its interaction with platelets
        *   Reduces the risk of thrombotic events and shortens the duration of plasma exchange
    *   Avoid Platelet Transfusions: Platelet transfusions may exacerbate the thrombotic process and are generally avoided unless life-threatening bleeding occurs

## **Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A potentially life-threatening immune-mediated disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of thrombosis following exposure to heparin
*   **Types:**
    *   Type I HIT (Non-Immune): Mild, transient thrombocytopenia occurring within the first 2 days of heparin exposure. Not clinically significant
    *   Type II HIT (Immune-Mediated):
        *   Antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex, leading to platelet activation and thrombosis
        *   Clinically significant and associated with a high risk of venous and arterial thrombosis
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Heparin-PF4 Complex Formation: Heparin binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4), a positively charged protein released from platelets
    *   Antibody Production: Patients develop IgG antibodies against the heparin-PF4 complex
    *   Platelet Activation: IgG antibodies bind to the heparin-PF4 complex on platelet surfaces, leading to platelet activation and aggregation via FcÎ³IIa receptors
    *   Thrombosis: Activated platelets release procoagulant factors, leading to thrombin generation and thrombosis
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Platelets are consumed in the formation of thrombi and cleared from the circulation
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Typically occurs 5-10 days after starting heparin (but can occur earlier with prior heparin exposure)
    *   Thrombosis: Venous and arterial thromboembolic events (e.g., DVT, pulmonary embolism, stroke, limb ischemia, skin necrosis)
    *   Skin Necrosis at Heparin Injection Sites
    *   Systemic Reactions: Chills, fever, dyspnea (less common)
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Thrombocytopenia (platelet count typically <150 x 10^9/L, but can be variable)
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Usually normal; may see large platelets
    *   HIT Antibody Testing:
        *   Screening Assay: ELISA or immunoturbidimetric assay to detect antibodies against heparin-PF4 complex (high sensitivity, but lower specificity)
        *   Confirmatory Assay: Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) or Heparin-Induced Platelet Activation (HIPA) assay (high specificity)
    *   Coagulation Studies:
        *   aPTT: May be prolonged, normal, or shortened
    *   D-dimer: Elevated
*   **Diagnosis:** 4Ts Scoring System
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Degree and timing of platelet count fall
    *   Timing: When did the thrombocytopenia occur in relation to Heparin use
    *   Thrombosis: Presence of new thrombosis or skin necrosis
    *   Other Causes for Thrombocytopenia: Absence of other obvious causes of thrombocytopenia
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Stop Heparin Immediately: This is the *most* important step
    *   Administer Alternative Anticoagulant:
        *   Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (DTIs): Argatroban, bivalirudin
        *   Fondaparinux: A synthetic pentasaccharide that inhibits factor Xa
    *   Avoid Platelet Transfusions: Platelet transfusions may exacerbate thrombosis in HIT
    *   Warfarin: Should be avoided acutely due to the risk of venous limb gangrene; can be initiated once the platelet count has recovered and the patient is on a stable dose of a non-heparin anticoagulant

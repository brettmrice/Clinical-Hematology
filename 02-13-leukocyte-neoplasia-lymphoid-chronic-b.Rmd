# Chronic B-Cell {-}

## **Overview of Chronic/Mature B-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma** {-}

*   **Definition:** A diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms arising from mature B lymphocytes. These are generally indolent (slow-growing) malignancies, though some can be more aggressive
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Clonal Proliferation: Proliferation of a single, abnormal clone of B cells
    *   Mature B-Cell Phenotype: Cells express markers of mature B cells (e.g., CD19, CD20)
    *   Variable Morphology: Cells may have variable size, shape, and nuclear features
    *   Lymph Node and Bone Marrow Involvement: Often involve lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and bone marrow
*   **Classification:** The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is used to categorize these disorders based on clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic features
*   **Common Disorders Included:**
    *   Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)
    *   Prolymphocytic Leukemia (PLL)
    *   Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL)
    *   Burkitt Lymphoma
    *   Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM)

## **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)** {-}

*   **Definition:** CLL and SLL are considered the same disease, differing primarily in the site of involvement. CLL primarily involves the blood and bone marrow, while SLL primarily involves the lymph nodes
*   **Diagnostic Criteria:**
    *   Peripheral Blood:
        *   Sustained absolute lymphocytosis (≥5.0 x 10^9/L) with a characteristic immunophenotype
        *   Smudge cells are often present on the peripheral blood smear
    *   Bone Marrow (Usually Not Required for Diagnosis):
        *   Lymphocytic infiltration
    *   Immunophenotype (by Flow Cytometry):
        *   CD5+, CD19+, CD20 (dim), CD23+, sIg (weak), CD10-
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Clonal proliferation of mature, usually naive B cells that express CD5 (a T-cell marker)
    *   Cells accumulate in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and blood
    *   Abnormal B cells are relatively immunocompetent, leading to increased susceptibility to infections
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Often asymptomatic at diagnosis
    *   Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes)
    *   Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen)
    *   Fatigue
    *   Weight loss
    *   Night sweats
    *   Increased susceptibility to infections
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Lymphocytosis (often marked, >20 x 10^9/L)
        *   Anemia (in advanced stages)
        *   Thrombocytopenia (in advanced stages)
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Small, mature lymphocytes with condensed chromatin
        *   Smudge cells: Fragile lymphocytes that rupture during smear preparation
    *   Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping:
        *   Confirms the diagnosis and differentiates CLL from other lymphoproliferative disorders
        *   CD5+, CD19+, CD20 (dim), CD23+, sIg (weak), CD10-
    *   Cytogenetic Analysis:
        *   Used to assess prognosis
        *   Common abnormalities: del(13q14), trisomy 12, del(11q22.3), del(17p13.1)
*   **Staging:**
    *   Rai Staging System (for CLL): Based on the presence and extent of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
    *   Binet Staging System (for CLL): Similar to Rai staging, but based on the number of involved lymphoid areas
*   **Prognosis:**
    *   Variable; some patients have an indolent course, while others have a more aggressive disease
    *   Prognostic factors: Stage, cytogenetic abnormalities, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutation status
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Watch and Wait: Many patients with early-stage CLL do not require immediate treatment
    *   Chemoimmunotherapy:
        *   Combination of chemotherapy drugs (e.g., fludarabine, cyclophosphamide) and monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab, obinutuzumab)

# Acute Lymphoid {-}

## **Overview of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** {-}

*   **Definition:** An aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by the rapid proliferation and accumulation of immature lymphoid cells (lymphoblasts) in the bone marrow, blood, and extramedullary sites. This uncontrolled proliferation crowds out normal hematopoietic cells
*   **Also Known As:** Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
*   **Cell Types Involved:** ALL can be classified into subtypes based on the cell lineage:
    *   B-Cell ALL (B-ALL): Most common type, involving precursor B cells
    *   T-Cell ALL (T-ALL): Less common type, involving precursor T cells
*   **Key Feature:** >20% lymphoblasts in the bone marrow
*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   ALL is the most common type of childhood leukemia, with a peak incidence between 2 and 5 years of age
    *   It also occurs in adults, but is less common
*   **Prognosis:** Varies depending on the subtype of ALL, genetic abnormalities, age, and other factors
*   **Overall, if treated, survival rates are generally higher in children than adults.**

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

*   **Genetic Mutations:** Acquired genetic mutations in lymphoid progenitor cells disrupt normal differentiation and proliferation, leading to:
    *   Uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts
    *   Arrest in cell maturation, with a buildup of immature cells
    *   Chromosomal translocations, deletions, and other genetic abnormalities are common
*   **Impaired Hematopoiesis:** Lymphoblasts accumulate in the bone marrow, crowding out normal hematopoietic cells and leading to:
    *   Anemia (decreased red blood cells)
    *   Thrombocytopenia (decreased platelets)
    *   Neutropenia (decreased neutrophils)
*   **Extramedullary Infiltration:** Lymphoblasts can infiltrate extramedullary sites, such as:
    *   Lymph nodes
    *   Spleen
    *   Liver
    *   Central nervous system (CNS)
    *   Testes

## **Etiology and Risk Factors** {-}

*   **Genetic Factors:**
    *   Chromosomal abnormalities:
        *   t(12;21)(p13.2;q22.1): *ETV6-RUNX1* (favorable prognosis, common in childhood B-ALL)
        *   t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2): *BCR-ABL1* (poor prognosis, more common in adult B-ALL)
        *   t(4;11)(q21;q23.3): *KMT2A* (MLL) rearrangement (poor prognosis, common in infants)
    *   Gene mutations:
        *   *NOTCH1* mutations (common in T-ALL)
        *   *TP53* mutations (associated with poor prognosis)
*   **Environmental Factors:**
    *   Exposure to ionizing radiation
    *   Exposure to certain chemicals (e.g., benzene)
    *   Prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (therapy-related ALL)
*   **Genetic Syndromes:**
    *   Down syndrome (increased risk of B-ALL)
    *   Neurofibromatosis type 1
    *   Fanconi anemia
*   **Age:**
    *   Peak incidence in childhood (2-5 years)
    *   Incidence increases again after age 50

## **Treatment** {-}

            *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):
                *   Allogeneic HSCT (from a matched donor) is the preferred consolidation therapy for patients with high-risk ALL
    *   Maintenance Therapy:
        *   Prolonged, lower-intensity chemotherapy to maintain remission
        *   Typically lasts for 2-3 years
    *   Central Nervous System (CNS) Prophylaxis:

        *   Inotuzumab Ozogamicin: An anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, a cytotoxic agent
*   **Supportive Care:**

    *   Transfusions (RBCs and platelets) to manage cytopenias
    *   Antibiotics and antifungals to treat infections
    *   Growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) to stimulate neutrophil production
    *   Management of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): A metabolic complication caused by the rapid breakdown of leukemic cells

## **Prognosis** {-}

*   **Factors Influencing Prognosis:**
    *   Cytogenetic Abnormalities: Certain chromosomal abnormalities are associated with favorable or unfavorable outcomes
    *   Age: Younger patients generally have better outcomes than older patients
    *   WBC Count at Diagnosis: High WBC count is associated with poorer prognosis
    *   Response to Induction Chemotherapy: Achievement of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity is a key prognostic factor
    *   Minimal Residual Disease (MRD):
        *   The presence of a small number of leukemic cells that remain after treatment
        *   Measured by flow cytometry or PCR
        *   MRD negativity is associated with improved outcomes
*   **Risk Stratification:**
    *   Patients are classified into risk groups (standard, high, or very high risk) based on prognostic factors
    *   Risk stratification guides treatment decisions and helps predict the likelihood of achieving long-term remission

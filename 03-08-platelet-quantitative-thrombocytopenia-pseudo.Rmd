# Pseudo {-}

## **Overview of Pseudothrombocytopenia** {-}

*   **Definition:** A falsely low platelet count reported by automated hematology analyzers due to in vitro platelet clumping or platelet satellitism. The *actual* platelet count in the patient is normal or only mildly reduced
*   **Significance:** Recognizing pseudothrombocytopenia is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis of true thrombocytopenia and to prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful investigations and treatments (e.g., bone marrow biopsy, platelet transfusions)
*   **Key Feature:** Platelet clumping or platelet satellitism is present on the peripheral blood smear, but the patient does not have clinical signs of bleeding (e.g., petechiae, purpura, easy bruising)

## **Mechanisms of Pseudothrombocytopenia** {-}
*   **EDTA-Induced Platelet Clumping:**

    *   *Most common cause* of pseudothrombocytopenia
    *   EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is the anticoagulant used in most CBC collection tubes
    *   In some individuals, EDTA triggers the exposure of cryptic platelet antigens (e.g., GPIIb/IIIa)
    *   Autoantibodies (usually IgG or IgM) against these exposed platelet antigens cause platelets to clump together in vitro
    *   The automated analyzer counts these clumps as single events, resulting in a falsely low platelet count
*   **Platelet Satellitism:**

    *   Less common than platelet clumping
    *   Platelets adhere to the surface of neutrophils or, less commonly, other blood cells (lymphocytes, RBCs)
    *   The automated analyzer may misidentify these platelets as part of the white blood cell population, leading to an inaccurate platelet count

## **Laboratory Findings** {-}

*   **Automated Platelet Count:**

    *   Falsely low platelet count (often significantly reduced)
    *   The degree of thrombocytopenia can vary depending on the severity of the platelet clumping or satellitism

*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**

    *   Essential for diagnosing pseudothrombocytopenia
    *   Platelet Clumps:
        *   Aggregates of platelets are visible on the smear, ranging from small clumps to large aggregates
        *   The clumps are often unevenly distributed on the smear
        *   The presence of platelet clumping is *essential* for diagnosing EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia
    *   Platelet Satellitism:
        *   Platelets adhere to the surface of neutrophils or other blood cells, forming a "ring" or "halo" around the cells
        *   May be difficult to distinguish from true platelet adherence in some cases

## **Corrective Action Procedure** {-}

The following steps should be taken when pseudothrombocytopenia is suspected:

1.  **Review the CBC Results and Peripheral Blood Smear:**
    *   Assess the platelet count and other CBC parameters
    *   Examine the peripheral blood smear to confirm the presence of platelet clumping or platelet satellitism
2.  **Repeat the CBC on a Sample Collected in a Different Anticoagulant:**
    *   This is the *most important* step
    *   Collect a new blood sample in a tube containing sodium citrate (light blue top) or heparin (green top) as the anticoagulant
    *   Citrate and heparin typically do not cause platelet clumping in individuals with EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia
    *   **Important Note:** Sodium citrate dilutes the blood sample, so the platelet count obtained from the citrate tube must be multiplied by a correction factor (usually 1.1) to account for the dilution:

        *Corrected Platelet Count = Platelet Count (Citrate Tube) x 1.1*
3.  **Perform a Manual Platelet Count:**
    *   If platelet clumping persists despite using an alternative anticoagulant, a manual platelet count may be necessary
    *   Prepare a well-made peripheral blood smear and count platelets manually, avoiding areas with platelet clumping
    *   Use a microscope with a calibrated eyepiece graticule to count platelets in a defined area or number of fields
4.  **Warm the Sample:**
    *   Warming the sample to 37°C may help disperse platelet clumps in some cases
    *   Incubate the sample at 37°C for 15-30 minutes before re-analyzing
5.  **Dilution:**
    *   Diluting the sample with saline or another appropriate diluent may help disperse platelet clumps
    *   Ensure that the dilution factor is accounted for when calculating the final platelet count
6.  **Rule Out Other Causes of Thrombocytopenia:**
    *   If the platelet count remains low despite corrective actions, consider other causes of true thrombocytopenia, such as:
        *   Increased platelet destruction (e.g., ITP, TTP, HIT)
        *   Decreased platelet production (e.g., bone marrow failure)
7.  **Documentation and Reporting:**
    *   Clearly document all corrective actions taken in the patient's laboratory record, including:
        *   The initial platelet count and the presence of platelet clumping on the smear
        *   The type of anticoagulant used for the repeat sample
        *   The corrected platelet count (if applicable)
        *   A comment indicating that pseudothrombocytopenia was present and that the results were corrected accordingly
    *   Report the corrected platelet count to the physician, noting that pseudothrombocytopenia was identified
8.  **Communication with the Physician:**
    *   Notify the physician about the presence of pseudothrombocytopenia and the corrective actions taken
    *   Explain the potential for falsely low platelet counts and the importance of relying on the corrected results
    *   Discuss the need for further investigation if the patient has clinical signs of bleeding or if the corrected platelet count is significantly low

## **Key Considerations** {-}

*   **Prompt Action:** It's essential to take prompt action when pseudothrombocytopenia is suspected to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatments
*   **Visual Confirmation:** Always confirm the presence of platelet clumping or satellitism on the peripheral blood smear before initiating corrective actions
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure accurate measurement and replacement of plasma volume when performing saline replacement procedures
*   **Documentation:** Thorough documentation of the procedure and results is essential for accurate reporting and patient management
*   **Communication:** Clear communication with the physician is critical for ensuring appropriate clinical decision-making

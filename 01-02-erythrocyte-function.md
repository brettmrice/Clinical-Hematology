# RBC Function {-}

## **Overview of Erythrocyte Function** {-}

*   **Primary Function:** Oxygen transport from the lungs to the tissues and carbon dioxide transport from the tissues to the lungs
*   **Key Components for Function:**
    *   Hemoglobin (HGB): The oxygen-carrying molecule within the RBC
    *   RBC Membrane: Provides flexibility and structural integrity
    *   Metabolic Pathways: Maintain RBC shape, flexibility, and hemoglobin function

## **Hemoglobin Structure and Function** {-}

*   **Structure:**
    *   Tetramer composed of four globin chains (two alpha-like and two beta-like)
    *   Each globin chain contains a heme molecule
    *   Each heme molecule contains an iron (Fe2+) atom, which binds to oxygen
*   **Oxygen Binding:**
    *   Each hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules
    *   Binding is cooperative, meaning that the binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity for subsequent oxygen molecules
*   **Oxygen Dissociation Curve:**
    *   Sigmoidal shape reflects the cooperative binding of oxygen
    *   **P50:** The partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated
        *   Increased P50: Indicates decreased oxygen affinity (right shift)
        *   Decreased P50: Indicates increased oxygen affinity (left shift)
*   **Factors Affecting Oxygen Affinity:**
    *   **pH:**
        *   Decreased pH (acidosis): Decreases oxygen affinity (Bohr effect)
        *   Increased pH (alkalosis): Increases oxygen affinity
    *   **Carbon Dioxide (CO2):**
        *   Increased CO2: Decreases oxygen affinity (Bohr effect)
        *   Decreased CO2: Increases oxygen affinity
    *   **Temperature:**
        *   Increased temperature: Decreases oxygen affinity
        *   Decreased temperature: Increases oxygen affinity
    *   **2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG):**
        *   Increased 2,3-DPG: Decreases oxygen affinity
        *   Decreased 2,3-DPG: Increases oxygen affinity

## **Hemoglobin Variants and Their Functions** {-}

*   **Hemoglobin A (HbA):**
    *   α2β2 (two alpha and two beta chains)
    *   Predominant hemoglobin in adults
*   **Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2):**
    *   α2δ2 (two alpha and two delta chains)
    *   Minor component in adults
*   **Hemoglobin F (HbF):**
    *   α2γ2 (two alpha and two gamma chains)
    *   Predominant hemoglobin in fetuses and newborns
    *   Higher affinity for oxygen than HbA
*   **Abnormal Hemoglobins:**
    *   Hemoglobin S (HbS):
        *   Causes sickle cell anemia
        *   Polymerizes under low oxygen conditions, leading to sickling of red blood cells
    *   Hemoglobin C (HbC):
        *   Causes mild hemolytic anemia
        *   Forms crystals within red blood cells
    *   Methemoglobin:
        *   Iron in the heme molecule is oxidized to the Fe3+ state
        *   Cannot bind to oxygen
    *   Carboxyhemoglobin:
        *   Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide (CO)
        *   Has a much higher affinity for CO than oxygen
        *   Impairs oxygen delivery to tissues

## **Red Blood Cell Membrane** {-}

*   **Structure:**
    *   Lipid bilayer with embedded proteins
    *   Provides flexibility and structural integrity to the red blood cell
*   **Key Membrane Proteins:**
    *   Spectrin:
        *   Major component of the cytoskeleton
        *   Provides structural support
    *   Ankyrin:
        *   Anchors the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane
    *   Band 3:
        *   Anion exchange protein (exchanges chloride and bicarbonate)
        *   Important for CO2 transport
    *   Glycophorin A:
        *   Major sialoglycoprotein
        *   Provides a negative charge that prevents RBC aggregation
*   **Membrane Defects:**
    *   Hereditary Spherocytosis:
        *   Defects in spectrin, ankyrin, or other membrane proteins
        *   Results in spherical-shaped red blood cells that are prone to destruction in the spleen
    *   Hereditary Elliptocytosis:
        *   Defects in spectrin or other membrane proteins
        *   Results in elliptical-shaped red blood cells

## **Red Blood Cell Metabolism** {-}

*   **Key Metabolic Pathways:**
    *   Glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof Pathway):
        *   Provides ATP for maintaining cell shape, membrane integrity, and ion transport
        *   Deficiency in pyruvate kinase (PK) can lead to hemolytic anemia
    *   Pentose Phosphate Pathway (Hexose Monophosphate Shunt):
        *   Produces NADPH, which protects against oxidative damage
        *   Deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) can lead to hemolytic anemia
    *   Methemoglobin Reductase Pathway:
        *   Maintains iron in the reduced (Fe2+) state
        *   Deficiency can lead to methemoglobinemia
    *   Rapport-Luebering Shunt:
        *   Produces 2,3-DPG, which regulates hemoglobin's oxygen affinity

## **Carbon Dioxide Transport** {-}

*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   Dissolved CO2 in Plasma:
        *   Small amount of CO2 is transported in the plasma
    *   Carbaminohemoglobin:
        *   CO2 binds to hemoglobin
    *   Bicarbonate (HCO3-):
        *   Most CO2 is transported as bicarbonate
        *   CO2 enters red blood cells and is converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) by carbonic anhydrase
        *   Carbonic acid dissociates into H+ and HCO3-
        *   HCO3- is exchanged for chloride (Cl-) via the anion exchange protein (Band 3) (chloride shift)

## **Red Blood Cell Destruction (Senescence)** {-}

*   **Process:**
    *   As red blood cells age, they become less flexible and more susceptible to damage
    *   Senescent red blood cells are removed from the circulation by macrophages in the spleen
*   **Hemoglobin Breakdown:**
    *   Hemoglobin is broken down into globin, iron, and porphyrin
    *   Globin is broken down into amino acids
    *   Iron is recycled or stored
    *   Porphyrin is converted to bilirubin, which is then excreted in the bile
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Increased red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) can lead to anemia and elevated bilirubin levels

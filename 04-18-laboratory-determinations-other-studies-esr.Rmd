# ESR {-}

## **Overview of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)** {-}

*   **Definition:** The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non-specific blood test that measures the rate at which red blood cells (RBCs) settle in a vertical tube over a period of one hour
*   **Alternative Name:** Sedimentation Rate, Sed Rate
*   **Principle:**
    *   Erythrocytes settle more rapidly in the presence of increased levels of acute-phase proteins in the plasma (e.g., fibrinogen, globulins)
    *   These proteins neutralize the negative charge on the RBC surface, reducing repulsion and promoting rouleaux formation (stacking of RBCs), which increases the sedimentation rate.
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Screening Test: A general indicator of inflammation and infection in the body, but it is not diagnostic for any specific condition
    *   Monitoring Disease Activity: Used to monitor the course of inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica) and response to treatment
    *   Detecting Occult Disease: Can be helpful in detecting hidden or occult inflammatory conditions
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Non-Specific: The ESR is affected by many factors and can be elevated in a wide range of conditions
    *   Lacks Sensitivity: The ESR may be normal in some patients with active inflammation
    *   Affected by Physiological Factors: Age, sex, pregnancy, and certain medications can affect the ESR
    *   Cannot localize the affected region

## **Methods for Measuring ESR** {-}

*   **Westergren Method:**

    *   The most commonly used method
    *   Uses a Westergren tube (a long, glass or plastic tube with a calibrated scale)
    *   Procedure:
        1.  Collect blood in an EDTA (purple-top) tube
        2.  Mix the blood thoroughly
        3.  Dilute the blood with sodium citrate or saline (4:1 ratio of blood to diluent)
        4.  Fill the Westergren tube to the 0 mm mark
        5.  Place the tube in a vertical rack and allow it to stand undisturbed at room temperature for 1 hour
        6.  Read the distance (in millimeters) that the RBCs have fallen from the top of the column to the top of the packed red cells after 1 hour
        7.  Report the result in mm/hr
*   **Wintrobe Method:**

    *   Less commonly used
    *   Uses a Wintrobe tube (a shorter, thicker glass tube with a calibrated scale)
    *   Procedure:
        1.  Collect blood in an EDTA (purple-top) tube
        2.  Mix the blood thoroughly
        3.  Fill the Wintrobe tube to the 0 mm mark
        4.  Place the tube in a vertical rack and allow it to stand undisturbed at room temperature for 1 hour
        5.  Read the distance (in millimeters) that the RBCs have fallen from the top of the column to the top of the packed red cells after 1 hour
        6.  Report the result in mm/hr
*   **Automated ESR Analyzers:**

    *   Some automated hematology analyzers can perform ESR measurements
    *   These methods are based on different principles than the manual methods, such as:
        *   Capillary photometry: Measures the rate of RBC aggregation in a capillary tube using optical sensors
        *   Microfluidic technology: Measures the sedimentation rate in a microfluidic channel

## **Factors Affecting the ESR** {-}

The ESR can be affected by several factors, both physiological and pathological. It's important to consider these factors when interpreting ESR results.

*   **Factors that Increase ESR:**

    *   Increased Acute Phase Reactants: Fibrinogen, Î±-globulins, and other acute-phase proteins increase RBC aggregation
    *   Rouleaux Formation: Increased rouleaux formation accelerates RBC sedimentation
    *   Anemia: Decreased RBC concentration reduces the competition for sedimentation
    *   Macrocytosis: Larger RBCs settle faster
    *   Female Sex: Females tend to have higher ESR values than males due to hormonal influences
    *   Age: ESR tends to increase with age
    *   Pregnancy: ESR is elevated during pregnancy
    *   Technical Factors: Tilting of the ESR tube, improper temperature

*   **Factors that Decrease ESR:**

    *   Abnormal Red Blood Cell Shape: Sickle cells or spherocytes hinder rouleaux formation and sedimentation
    *   Polycythemia: Increased RBC concentration slows down sedimentation
    *   Hypofibrinogenemia: Decreased fibrinogen levels reduce rouleaux formation
    *   Very High Leukocytosis: Increased cell numbers can affect the test
    *   Technical Factors: Clotted sample, air bubbles in the tube

## **Clinical Significance of ESR** {-}

*   **Elevated ESR:**
    *   Inflammatory Conditions:
        *   Rheumatoid arthritis
        *   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
        *   Polymyalgia rheumatica
        *   Giant cell arteritis
    *   Infections:
        *   Bacterial infections (e.g., pneumonia, osteomyelitis)
        *   Tuberculosis
        *   Fungal infections
    *   Malignancies:
        *   Multiple myeloma
        *   Lymphoma
        *   Metastatic cancer
    *   Tissue Damage:
        *   Trauma
        *   Surgery
    *   Other Conditions:
        *   Pregnancy
        *   Chronic kidney disease
        *   Thyroid disorders
*   **Normal or Decreased ESR:**
    *   Does not rule out significant disease
    *   May be seen in:
        *   Early stages of inflammatory conditions
        *   Non-inflammatory conditions
        *   Technical errors

## **Quality Control** {-}

*   **Use Proper Technique:**
    *   Follow standardized procedures for sample collection, dilution, and reading
    *   Avoid introducing air bubbles into the tube
    *   Ensure that the tube is placed in a vertical rack
*   **Check Reagents and Equipment:**
    *   Use fresh reagents and ensure that they are stored properly
    *   Verify the accuracy of the pipettes and measuring devices
    *   Maintain the centrifuge and other equipment according to the manufacturer's instructions
*   **Run Controls:**
    *   Use control materials with known ESR values
    *   Monitor control results to ensure accuracy and precision
*   **External Quality Assurance:**
    *   Participate in proficiency testing programs to assess the performance of the laboratory's ESR testing

## **Reporting Results** {-}

*   Report the ESR value in the appropriate units (mm/hr)
*   Include the reference range for the patient's age and sex
*   Note the method used (e.g., Westergren, Wintrobe)
*   Qualify the results with any relevant comments (e.g., "Elevated ESR, clinical correlation advised")
*   Always interpret results in conjunction with clinical information!

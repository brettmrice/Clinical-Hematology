# Hereditary Hemolytic {-}

## **Overview of Hemolytic Anemias** {-}

*   **Definition:** Anemia caused by increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction (hemolysis), either intravascularly (within the blood vessels) or extravascularly (primarily in the spleen and liver)
*   **Hallmarks:**
    *   Shortened RBC lifespan
    *   Increased erythropoiesis (increased reticulocyte count)
    *   Accumulation of hemoglobin breakdown products (e.g., bilirubin, LDH)
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Intrinsic (Inherited) Hemolytic Anemias:**
        *   Result from defects within the RBC itself
        *   Include membrane defects, enzyme deficiencies, and hemoglobinopathies
    *   **Extrinsic (Acquired) Hemolytic Anemias:**
        *   Result from external factors that cause RBC destruction
        *   Include immune-mediated hemolysis, mechanical trauma, infections, and chemical injury

## **Intrinsic Hemolytic Anemias: Membrane Defects** {-}

*   **General Pathophysiology:**
    *   Defects in RBC membrane proteins disrupt the structural integrity and flexibility of the membrane
    *   Abnormally shaped RBCs are more susceptible to splenic sequestration and destruction
*   **Common Features:**
    *   Splenomegaly (due to increased splenic workload)
    *   Jaundice (due to elevated bilirubin levels)
    *   Increased osmotic fragility
*   **Specific Membrane Defects:**

    *   **Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS):**
        *   **Defect:** Primarily caused by mutations in genes encoding spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, or protein 4.2
            *   These proteins are essential for maintaining the biconcave shape and flexibility of RBCs
        *   **Pathophysiology:** Protein deficiencies lead to loss of membrane surface area, resulting in spherical-shaped RBCs (spherocytes)
            *   Spherocytes have decreased deformability and are trapped and destroyed in the spleen
        *   **Clinical Findings:**
            *   Anemia (variable severity)
            *   Jaundice
            *   Splenomegaly
            *   Bilirubin gallstones (cholelithiasis)
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**
            *   CBC:
                *   Normal to decreased HGB and HCT
                *   Normal or decreased MCV (may be falsely low due to spherocytes)
                *   Increased MCHC (often >36 g/dL)
                *   Increased RDW
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
                *   Spherocytes (hallmark finding)
                *   Polychromasia (increased reticulocytes)
                *   Absence of central pallor in spherocytes
            *   Reticulocyte Count: Elevated
            *   Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT): Negative (unless there is a coexisting autoimmune process)
            *   Osmotic Fragility Test: Increased osmotic fragility (RBCs lyse more readily in hypotonic solutions)
        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Splenectomy: Mainstay of treatment for severe HS
                *   Reduces hemolysis and improves anemia
                *   Increases risk of infection with encapsulated organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis)
                *   Patients require vaccination before splenectomy
            *   Folic acid supplementation
            *   Blood transfusions (in severe cases)

    *   **Hereditary Elliptocytosis (HE):**
        *   **Defect:** Primarily caused by mutations in genes encoding spectrin, protein 4.1, or glycophorin C
        *   **Pathophysiology:** Protein defects disrupt the horizontal interactions in the RBC cytoskeleton, leading to elliptical-shaped RBCs (elliptocytes)
        *   **Clinical Findings:**
            *   Most patients are asymptomatic
            *   Variable degrees of anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice
            *   Severe forms (e.g., hereditary pyropoikilocytosis) can cause significant hemolysis
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**
            *   CBC:
                *   Normal to decreased HGB and HCT
                *   Normal MCV
                *   Normal MCHC

        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Most patients require no treatment
            *   Splenectomy: May be considered in patients with severe hemolysis
            *   Folic acid supplementation
            *   Blood transfusions (in severe cases)

    *   **Hereditary Pyropoikilocytosis (HPP):**
        *   **Defect:** A severe form of hereditary elliptocytosis with compound heterozygosity for spectrin mutations
        *   **Pathophysiology:** Marked spectrin deficiency leads to extreme poikilocytosis (abnormal RBC shapes) and heat sensitivity
            *   RBCs fragment at temperatures that are normally well-tolerated
        *   **Clinical Findings:**
            *   Severe microcytic hemolytic anemia
            *   Marked poikilocytosis
            *   Splenomegaly
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**
            *   CBC:
                *   Decreased HGB and HCT
                *   Very low MCV
                *   Increased RDW
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
                *   Extreme poikilocytosis (hallmark finding)
                *   Microspherocytes, elliptocytes, fragmented cells

        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Splenectomy: Mainstay of treatment
            *   Folic acid supplementation
            *   Blood transfusions (often required)

    *   **Hereditary Stomatocytosis:**
        *   **Defect:** Mutations affecting membrane cation permeability, particularly the PIEZO1 and stomatin (band 7) proteins
        *   **Pathophysiology:** Altered cation permeability leads to changes in RBC volume and shape
            *   **Overhydrated Hereditary Stomatocytosis (OHS):** Increased influx of sodium and water into RBCs, leading to swelling and stomatocytes (mouth-like appearance)
            *   **Dehydrated Hereditary Stomatocytosis (DHS):** Increased efflux of potassium and water from RBCs, leading to dehydration and spiculated cells (e.g., echinocytes)
        *   **Clinical Findings:**
            *   Variable degrees of hemolytic anemia
            *   Splenomegaly
            *   Jaundice
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**
            *   CBC:
                *   Variable HGB and HCT (depending on the severity of hemolysis)
                *   Increased MCV (in OHS) or decreased MCV (in DHS)
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
                *   Stomatocytes (in OHS): RBCs with a slit-like area of central pallor
                *   Spiculated cells (echinocytes) (in DHS)
            *   Reticulocyte Count: Elevated
            *   Osmotic Fragility Test: Variable (increased in OHS, decreased in DHS)
        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Splenectomy: May be considered in severe cases of OHS, but carries a risk of thrombosis
            *   Iron overload: Can occur in DHS due to increased iron absorption
            *   Folic acid supplementation
            *   Blood transfusions (in severe cases)

## **Intrinsic Hemolytic Anemias: Enzyme Deficiencies** {-}

*   **General Pathophysiology:**
    *   Deficiencies in enzymes essential for RBC metabolism disrupt energy production or antioxidant defenses
    *   Leads to premature RBC destruction, especially under conditions of stress
*   **Common Features:**
    *   Hemolytic anemia
    *   Elevated reticulocyte count
    *   Elevated indirect bilirubin
    *   Decreased haptoglobin
*   **Specific Enzyme Deficiencies:**

    *   **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency:**
        *   **Defect:** Deficiency of G6PD, an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (hexose monophosphate shunt)
        *   **Pathophysiology:**
            *   G6PD is essential for producing NADPH, which protects RBCs from oxidative damage
            *   Without NADPH, RBCs are vulnerable to oxidative stress from infections, drugs, or certain foods (e.g., fava beans)
            *   Oxidative stress leads to hemoglobin denaturation and formation of Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin precipitates)
            *   Heinz bodies damage the RBC membrane, leading to intravascular and extravascular hemolysis
        *   **Inheritance:** X-linked recessive; more common in males
        *   **Clinical Findings:**
            *   Most individuals are asymptomatic until exposed to an oxidative stressor
            *   Acute hemolytic anemia:
                *   Sudden onset of jaundice, dark urine, and fatigue
                *   Symptoms usually resolve within a few weeks after the oxidative stressor is removed
            *   Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (in some severe variants)
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**
            *   CBC:
                *   Decreased HGB and HCT
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
                *   Bite cells (RBCs with a portion removed by splenic macrophages)
                *   Heinz bodies (require special stain, e.g., crystal violet or brilliant green)
                *   Polychromasia
            *   Reticulocyte Count: Elevated
            *   G6PD Assay:
                *   Decreased G6PD enzyme activity (may be normal during acute hemolytic episodes due to increased reticulocytes)
        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Avoidance of oxidative stressors (certain drugs, foods, and infections)
            *   Supportive care during hemolytic episodes:
                *   Hydration
                *   Blood transfusions (in severe cases)
            *   Folic acid supplementation

    *   **Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Deficiency:**
        *   **Defect:** Deficiency of pyruvate kinase (PK), an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway (Embden-Meyerhof pathway)
        *   **Pathophysiology:**
            *   PK is essential for generating ATP, which is required to maintain RBC shape, membrane integrity, and ion transport
            *   Without sufficient ATP, RBCs become rigid, dehydrated, and prone to splenic sequestration
            *   Results in chronic hemolytic anemia
        *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal recessive
        *   **Clinical Findings:**
            *   Chronic hemolytic anemia
            *   Jaundice
            *   Splenomegaly
            *   Gallstones (cholelithiasis)
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**
            *   CBC:
                *   Decreased HGB and HCT
                *   Normal to decreased MCV (can be slightly macrocytic in some cases)
                *   Normal MCHC
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
                *   Normal shape or slight poikilocytosis
                *   No spherocytes
            *   Reticulocyte Count: Markedly elevated
            *   Pyruvate Kinase (PK) Assay:
                *   Decreased PK enzyme activity
        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Blood transfusions (may be needed, especially in severe cases)
            *   Splenectomy: May reduce transfusion requirements but increases the risk of thrombosis
            *   Folic acid supplementation

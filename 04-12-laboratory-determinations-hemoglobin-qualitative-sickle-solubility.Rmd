# Sickle Solubility {-}

## **Overview of Sickle Solubility Testing** {-}

*   **Definition:** A rapid, qualitative screening test used to detect the presence of Hemoglobin S (HbS) in a blood sample
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Screening for Sickle Cell Disease: Used as a preliminary test to identify individuals who may have sickle cell trait (HbAS) or sickle cell anemia (HbSS)
    *   Simple and Inexpensive: Can be performed in resource-limited settings where more sophisticated tests (e.g., hemoglobin electrophoresis, HPLC) are not readily available
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Qualitative Test: Only detects the presence of HbS, does not quantify the amount
    *   Cannot Differentiate between HbAS (sickle cell trait) and HbSS (sickle cell anemia)
    *   False-Negative Results: Can occur in infants < 6 months old (due to high levels of HbF), in patients with very low hemoglobin levels, or in patients who have received recent blood transfusions
    *   False-Positive Results: Can occur in patients with other hemoglobinopathies (e.g., HbC-Harlem) or with hyperglobulinemia
    *   Confirmatory Testing Required: Positive results must be confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC

## **Principle of the Sickle Solubility Test** {-}

*   **Solubility of Hemoglobin S:**
    *   HbS is insoluble in a concentrated phosphate buffer when deoxygenated (oxygen removed)
    *   When deoxygenated, HbS molecules polymerize, forming long fibers that cause the red blood cells to sickle
    *   The polymerization and sickling process leads to turbidity (cloudiness) of the solution
*   **Other Hemoglobins:**
    *   Normal hemoglobin (HbA) and most other hemoglobin variants remain soluble in the buffer, so the solution remains clear
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Blood is mixed with a lysing agent to release hemoglobin
    2.  A reducing agent is added to deoxygenate the hemoglobin
    3.  The hemolysate is added to a concentrated phosphate buffer
    4.  The mixture is observed for turbidity
    5.  If HbS is present, the solution will become turbid
    6.  If HbS is absent, the solution will remain clear

## **Reagents and Materials** {-}

*   **Lysing Reagent:** Saponin or other reagent to lyse red blood cells and release hemoglobin
*   **Reducing Agent:** Sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) to deoxygenate the hemoglobin
*   **Phosphate Buffer:** Concentrated phosphate buffer (e.g., sodium phosphate) to reduce the solubility of HbS
*   **Distilled Water:** To prepare reagents and dilute samples
*   **Test Tubes or Microcentrifuge Tubes:** To mix the reagents and sample
*   **Pipettes:** To accurately measure reagents and samples
*   **Light Source:** A light source (e.g., a flashlight or a viewbox) to observe the turbidity of the solution
*   **Control Samples:** Positive and negative controls with known HbS status

## **Procedure** {-}

1.  Prepare the Reagents: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare the lysing reagent, reducing agent, and phosphate buffer
2.  Prepare the Sample:
    *   Collect blood in an EDTA (purple-top) tube
    *   Mix the blood thoroughly
    *   Add a specified amount of blood to a test tube or microcentrifuge tube
3.  Lyse the Red Blood Cells:
    *   Add the lysing reagent to the blood sample
    *   Mix gently and allow the mixture to stand for a few minutes to ensure complete lysis
4.  Deoxygenate the Hemoglobin:
    *   Add the reducing agent (sodium hydrosulfite) to the hemolysate
    *   Mix gently
5.  Add Phosphate Buffer:
    *   Add the concentrated phosphate buffer to the mixture
    *   Mix gently
6.  Incubate (Optional):
    *   Some protocols recommend incubating the mixture at room temperature for a specific time (e.g., 5-10 minutes)
7.  Observe for Turbidity:
    *   Hold the tube in front of a light source and observe the turbidity of the solution
    *   Compare the test sample to positive and negative controls
8.  Interpret the Results:
    *   Positive Result: The solution is turbid, indicating the presence of HbS
    *   Negative Result: The solution remains clear, indicating the absence of HbS

## **Interpreting Results** {-}

*   **Positive Result (Turbid Solution):** Indicates the presence of HbS
    *   Does not differentiate between sickle cell trait (HbAS) and sickle cell anemia (HbSS)
    *   Requires confirmation by hemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC
*   **Negative Result (Clear Solution):** Indicates the absence of HbS
    *   Does not rule out other hemoglobinopathies
    *   False-negative results can occur, especially in infants < 6 months old due to high levels of HbF

## **Factors Affecting Accuracy** {-}

*   **High Hematocrit:**

    *   High concentrations of hemoglobin can lead to false-positive results
    *   Dilute the sample before performing the test

*   **Lipemia:**

    *   Turbidity from lipemia can interfere with the visual interpretation of the test
    *   Centrifuge the sample and use the clear bottom layer for testing

*   **High White Blood Cell Count:**

    *   Can interfere with visual interpretation
    *   Lyse the white blood cells before performing the test

*   **Recent Transfusion:**

    *   Can lead to false-negative results if the patient has been recently transfused with blood that does not contain HbS
    *   Wait at least 3 months after transfusion before performing the test

*   **Hemoglobin Variants Other Than HbS:**

    *   Some rare hemoglobin variants (e.g., HbC-Harlem) can also cause a positive result
    *   Confirm positive results with hemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC

## **Quality Control** {-}

*   **Run Positive and Negative Controls with Each Test Batch:**
    *   Positive Control: A sample with known HbS
    *   Negative Control: A sample with normal hemoglobin (HbA)
*   **Use Fresh Reagents:**
    *   Ensure that the reagents are not expired and have been stored properly
*   **Follow the Manufacturer's Instructions Carefully:**
    *   Adhere to the recommended sample volumes, reagent concentrations, and incubation times
*   **Inspect the Reagents and Equipment:**
    *   Check for any signs of contamination or deterioration
    *   Ensure that the light source is adequate for visualizing the turbidity of the solution

## **Reporting Results** {-}

*   Report the result as "Positive" or "Negative" for HbS
*   Indicate that the test is a screening test and requires confirmation by hemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC for a definitive diagnosis
*   Include any comments or qualifications, such as "False negative possible in infants < 6 months old" or "Heterozygous result"

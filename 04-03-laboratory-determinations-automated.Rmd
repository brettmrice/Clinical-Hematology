# Automated {-}

## **Overview of Automated Cell Counts** {-}

*   **Definition:** Automated cell counts are performed using sophisticated instruments called hematology analyzers, which rapidly and accurately count and characterize blood cells in whole blood and body fluids
*   **Advantages over Manual Methods:**
    *   Increased Speed and Efficiency: Automated analyzers can process a large number of samples quickly and efficiently
    *   Improved Accuracy and Precision: Automated methods generally provide more accurate and precise results than manual methods
    *   Reduced Labor Costs: Automated analyzers reduce the need for manual cell counts, freeing up laboratory personnel for other tasks
    *   Standardization: Automated methods provide more standardized and reproducible results
    *   Ability to Measure Additional Parameters: Automated analyzers can measure a wide range of parameters beyond just cell counts (e.g., cell size, hemoglobin concentration, cell differentials)
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Cost: Automated analyzers are expensive to purchase and maintain
    *   Complexity: Requires trained personnel to operate and maintain the instruments
    *   Interference: Certain substances or conditions can interfere with automated cell counts, leading to inaccurate results
    *   Need for Validation: Automated methods for body fluid cell counts must be validated before clinical use

## **Principles of Automated Cell Counting Technologies** {-}

*   **Electrical Impedance (Coulter Principle):**
    *   Principle: Cells are suspended in an electrolyte solution and pass through a small aperture. As each cell passes through the aperture, it displaces a volume of electrolyte, causing a change in electrical impedance
    *   Cell Counting: The number of impedance changes is proportional to the number of cells
    *   Cell Sizing: The magnitude of the impedance change is proportional to the cell volume
    *   Advantages: Simple and reliable method for cell counting and sizing
    *   Limitations: Cannot differentiate between different cell types based on size alone; susceptible to interference from non-cellular particles
*   **Optical Scatter:**
    *   Principle: Cells pass through a focused light beam (laser or tungsten-halogen lamp), and the amount and angle of light scattered by each cell are measured
    *   Forward Scatter (FS): Measures the amount of light scattered in the forward direction; related to cell size
    *   Side Scatter (SS): Measures the amount of light scattered at a 90-degree angle; related to cell granularity and internal complexity
    *   Cell Differentiation: Different cell types scatter light in different ways, allowing the analyzer to differentiate between RBCs, WBCs, and platelets
    *   Advantages: Can differentiate between different cell types and provide information about cell structure
    *   Limitations: Can be affected by interfering substances (e.g., lipemia, protein)
*   **Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Principle: Cells are stained with fluorescent dyes that bind to specific cell surface markers or intracellular components and are then passed through a laser beam. The fluorescence intensity and scatter patterns are measured
    *   Cell Identification: Cells are identified and quantified based on their fluorescence and scatter properties
    *   Immunophenotyping: Can identify specific cell populations based on their expression of cell surface markers (e.g., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells)
    *   Advantages: High sensitivity and specificity for cell identification; can measure multiple parameters simultaneously
    *   Limitations: More complex and expensive than other methods
*   **Cytochemical Staining:**
    *   Principle: The analyzer uses cytochemical stains to differentiate cell types based on their enzymatic activity or other chemical properties
    *   Example:
        *   Myeloperoxidase (MPO) stain: Used to differentiate myeloblasts (positive for MPO) from lymphoblasts (negative for MPO) in acute leukemia
    *   Advantages: Can provide additional information for cell classification
    *   Limitations: Requires specific reagents and controls

# Special Stains {-}

## **Overview of Special Stains** {-}

*   **Definition:** Histochemical staining techniques used in hematology to identify specific cellular components or enzymatic activities that aid in the classification and diagnosis of hematologic disorders
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Differentiate Cell Lineages: Distinguish between myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid cells
    *   Identify Abnormalities: Detect specific inclusions or enzymatic activities that are characteristic of certain diseases
    *   Classify Leukemias: Aid in the classification of acute leukemias
    *   Assess Iron Stores: Evaluate iron levels in the bone marrow and identify abnormal iron deposition
    *   Detect Fetal-Maternal Hemorrhage: Quantify fetal cells in the maternal circulation
*   **Methods:** Involve specific staining procedures performed on peripheral blood smears or bone marrow aspirate smears, followed by microscopic examination


## **Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Stain:** {-}

*   *Principle:* Detects the presence of myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in the primary granules of myeloid cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes)
*   *Procedure:*
    1.  Prepare a smear from bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
    2.  Fix the smear
    3.  Incubate the smear with a substrate (e.g., benzidine dihydrochloride or 3,3'-diaminobenzidine) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
    4.  MPO in the cells catalyzes the oxidation of the substrate, producing a colored precipitate
    5.  Counterstain the smear (e.g., with hematoxylin)
    6.  Examine the smear under a microscope
*   *Interpretation:*
    *   Positive: Myeloblasts, promyelocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils show granular staining pattern
    *   Negative: Lymphoblasts, megakaryocytes, and erythrocytes are negative
    *   Monocytes: Show weak, diffuse positivity
*   *Clinical Significance:*
    *   Differentiate AML from ALL: MPO is positive in myeloblasts and negative in lymphoblasts, helping distinguish between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
    *   Subclassification of AML: Helps identify specific AML subtypes (e.g., AML with minimal differentiation may be MPO-negative)

## **Esterase Stains:** {-}

*   *Principle:* Detect the presence of esterase enzymes in myeloid and monocytic cells; two main types:
    *   Specific Esterase (Chloroacetate Esterase, CAE): Detects chloroacetate esterase, which is primarily found in granulocytes (neutrophils)
    *   Non-Specific Esterase (α-Naphthyl Butyrate Esterase, ANBE): Detects α-naphthyl butyrate esterase, which is found in monocytes and macrophages
*   *Procedure:*
    1.  Prepare a smear from bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
    2.  Fix the smear
    3.  Incubate the smear with the appropriate substrate (chloroacetate ester or α-naphthyl butyrate) and a diazonium salt
    4.  Esterase enzymes in the cells hydrolyze the substrate, and the released product reacts with the diazonium salt to form a colored precipitate
    5.  Counterstain the smear
    6.  Examine the smear under a microscope
*   *Interpretation:*
    *   Specific Esterase (CAE):
        *   Positive: Neutrophils and their precursors show granular staining
        *   Negative: Monocytes, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes are negative
    *   Non-Specific Esterase (ANBE):
        *   Positive: Monocytes and macrophages show diffuse staining
        *   Negative: Neutrophils and lymphocytes are negative
    *   Combined Esterase Stains:
        *   Some procedures use both specific and non-specific esterase stains to better differentiate cell types
        *   Inhibition of Non-Specific Esterase with Sodium Fluoride (NaF): Monocytic staining is inhibited by NaF, while granulocytic staining is not
*   *Clinical Significance:*
    *   Differentiate Myeloid and Monocytic Lineages: ANBE and CAE are used to identify leukemias of monocytic lineage (e.g., acute monoblastic leukemia) from myeloblastic lineage (e.g., AML with minimal differentiation)
    *   Classification of AML: Helps subclassify AML based on the degree of monocytic differentiation

## **Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) Stain:** {-}

*   *Principle:* Detects glycogen and other carbohydrate-containing molecules in cells
*   *Procedure:*
    1.  Prepare a smear from bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
    2.  Oxidize the smear with periodic acid
    3.  React the oxidized carbohydrates with Schiff reagent, forming a magenta-colored product
    4.  Counterstain the smear (e.g., with hematoxylin)
    5.  Examine the smear under a microscope
*   *Interpretation:*
    *   Diffuse Positivity: Seen in erythroblasts
    *   Block-Like Positivity: Seen in lymphoblasts
    *   Negative: Other cell types, staining is very light or not present
*   *Clinical Significance:*
    *   Diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): Lymphoblasts in ALL often show coarse, block-like PAS positivity
    *   Diagnosis of Erythroleukemia: Erythroid precursors show strong PAS positivity
    *   Identification of Certain Storage Diseases: Used to detect glycogen storage in certain lysosomal storage disorders

## **Prussian Blue Stain (Iron Stain):** {-}

*   *Principle:* Detects ferric iron (Fe3+) in tissues and cells
    Uses potassium ferrocyanide to react with ferric iron to produce insoluble blue complex
*   *Procedure:*
    1.  Prepare a smear from bone marrow aspirate
    2.  Fix the smear
    3.  Flood the smear with a solution of potassium ferrocyanide and hydrochloric acid (Perl's Prussian blue reagent)
    4.  Counterstain the smear (e.g., with nuclear fast red)
    5.  Examine the smear under a microscope
*   *Interpretation:*
    *   Iron Granules:
        *   Sideroblasts: Normal erythroblasts contain a few iron granules
        *   Ringed Sideroblasts: Abnormal erythroblasts with iron-laden mitochondria encircling the nucleus (seen in sideroblastic anemias)
    *   Macrophages: Iron stores in macrophages can be assessed (increased in iron overload, decreased in iron deficiency)
*   *Clinical Significance:*
    *   Diagnosis of Sideroblastic Anemia: Identification of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow
    *   Assessment of Iron Stores: Evaluates iron levels in the bone marrow and helps differentiate between iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease
    *   Diagnosis of Hemochromatosis: Detects iron overload in tissues

    5.  Add a substrate that reacts with the enzyme to produce a colored product
    6.  Examine the smear under a microscope
*   *Interpretation:*
    *   Positive: Lymphoblasts show nuclear staining
    *   Negative: Mature lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and erythroid cells are negative
*   *Clinical Significance:*
    *   Differentiate AML from ALL: TdT is positive in most cases of T-cell ALL and some cases of B-cell ALL, but is usually negative in AML
    *   Diagnosis of Lymphoblastic Lymphoma: TdT is positive in lymphoblasts in lymphoblastic lymphoma

## **Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP)** {-}

## **Kleihauer-Betke (Acid Elution)** {-}

*   *Principle:* Detects fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in maternal blood
*   *Procedure:*
    1.  Prepare a blood smear from the maternal blood
    2.  Treat the smear with an acid solution, which elutes (removes) adult hemoglobin (HbA) from the red blood cells
    3.  Stain the smear with a counterstain (e.g., erythrosine)
    4.  Examine the smear under a microscope
*   *Interpretation:*
    *   Adult Red Blood Cells: Appear as "ghost cells" (pale or colorless) because the adult hemoglobin has been eluted
    *   Fetal Red Blood Cells: Contain HbF, which is resistant to acid elution, and stain pink
*   *Quantitative Determination of Fetal Cells:*
    *   Count the number of fetal cells per 100 adult cells under the microscope
    *   Calculate the percentage of fetal cells in the maternal circulation
*   *Clinical Significance:*
    *   Detection and Quantification of Fetal-Maternal Hemorrhage (FMH): FMH occurs when fetal red blood cells enter the maternal circulation
    *   Calculation of RhoGAM Dose: Used to determine the appropriate dose of RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin) to administer to Rh-negative mothers to prevent Rh sensitization
*   *Calculation of RhoGAM Dose:*
    *   Estimate the volume of fetal blood in the maternal circulation using the following formula:
        % Fetal Cells x Maternal Blood Volume = Volume of Fetal Blood (mL)
        *   The maternal blood volume is estimated based on the mother's weight and hematocrit
    *   One vial of RhoGAM (300 μg) covers 30 mL of fetal whole blood or 15 mL of fetal red blood cells
    *   Calculate the number of RhoGAM vials needed:
        Number of Vials = Volume of Fetal Blood (mL) / 30 mL
    *   Round up to the nearest whole number and add one additional vial for safety

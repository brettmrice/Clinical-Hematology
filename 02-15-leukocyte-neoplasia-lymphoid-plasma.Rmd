# Plasma Cell {-}

## **Overview of Plasma Cell Dyscrasias** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of disorders characterized by the abnormal proliferation of a single clone of plasma cells, leading to the overproduction of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein)
*   **Synonyms:** Monoclonal Gammopathies, Plasma Cell Disorders
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Monoclonal Gammopathy: The presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) in the serum or urine. The M protein is produced by the abnormal clone of plasma cells
    *   Bone Marrow Involvement: The bone marrow is often infiltrated by the clonal plasma cells
    *   Organ Damage: May lead to organ damage due to M protein deposition, bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, and increased susceptibility to infections
*   **Spectrum of Disorders:** Range from benign to malignant:
    *   Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS): Benign condition with low levels of M protein and no evidence of end-organ damage
    *   Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM): Intermediate condition with higher levels of M protein but still no end-organ damage
    *   Multiple Myeloma (MM): Malignant plasma cell disorder with M protein, bone marrow involvement, and end-organ damage
    *   Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM): A lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma that produces IgM M protein (covered in the previous study guide)
    *   Other Plasma Cell Dyscrasias: Rare disorders such as heavy chain diseases and plasma cell leukemia

## **Multiple Myeloma (MM)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to the overproduction of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) and associated end-organ damage
*   **Diagnostic Criteria:**
    *   Clonal Bone Marrow Plasma Cells ≥10% or Biopsy-Proven Extramedullary Plasmacytoma
    *   Presence of M Protein in Serum and/or Urine (except in rare cases of nonsecretory myeloma)
    *   Evidence of End-Organ Damage (CRAB Criteria):
        *   Hypercalcemia: Elevated serum calcium level
        *   Renal Insufficiency: Elevated creatinine or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
        *   Anemia: Low hemoglobin level
        *   Bone Lesions: Lytic lesions, fractures, or osteopenia on skeletal survey or imaging studies
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Clonal Plasma Cell Proliferation: Abnormal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow, disrupting normal hematopoiesis
    *   M Protein Production: Excessive production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgD, or IgE) or light chains (kappa or lambda)
    *   Bone Destruction: Myeloma cells secrete factors that stimulate osteoclast activity, leading to bone resorption and lytic lesions
    *   Immunosuppression: Myeloma cells suppress the normal immune system, increasing susceptibility to infections
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Bone Pain: Most common symptom
    *   Fatigue and Weakness: Due to anemia
    *   Pathologic Fractures: Fractures that occur with minimal trauma due to weakened bones
    *   Recurrent Infections: Due to immunosuppression
    *   Renal Insufficiency: Due to M protein deposition in the kidneys (myeloma cast nephropathy)
    *   Hypercalcemia: Can cause confusion, constipation, and kidney damage
    *   Neurological Symptoms: Due to spinal cord compression or hyperviscosity syndrome
    *   Amyloidosis: Deposition of light chains in tissues, causing organ damage

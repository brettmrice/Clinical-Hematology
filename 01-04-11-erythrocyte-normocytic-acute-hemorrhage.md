# Acute Hemorrhage {-}

## **Overview of Acute Hemorrhage** {-}

*   **Definition:** Sudden and significant blood loss occurring over a short period of time
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Rapid loss of blood volume leads to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
    *   The body compensates through various mechanisms, including increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, and fluid shifts
    *   If blood loss is severe and/or compensation is inadequate, hypovolemic shock and organ damage can occur
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   The *initial* laboratory findings may *not* reflect the severity of blood loss due to the proportional loss of all blood components (RBCs, WBCs, platelets, and plasma).
    *   Changes in laboratory values (e.g., decreased HGB and HCT) become apparent as the body attempts to restore blood volume through fluid shifts
*   **Classification:**
    *   **External Hemorrhage:** Blood loss visible outside the body (e.g., trauma, surgery)
    *   **Internal Hemorrhage:** Blood loss within the body (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured aneurysm)

## **Causes of Acute Hemorrhage** {-}

*   **Trauma:**
    *   Accidents
    *   Surgery
    *   Gunshot wounds
    *   Stabbing injuries
*   **Gastrointestinal Bleeding:**
    *   Peptic ulcers
    *   Esophageal varices
    *   Diverticulosis
    *   Colorectal cancer
*   **Obstetrical and Gynecological Causes:**
    *   Ectopic pregnancy rupture
    *   Postpartum hemorrhage
    *   Placenta previa or abruption
*   **Vascular Rupture:**
    *   Aortic aneurysm rupture
    *   Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) rupture
*   **Coagulation Disorders:**
    *   Hemophilia
    *   Von Willebrand disease
    *   Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
    *   Anticoagulant medication overdose

## **Clinical Manifestations** {-}

*   **Symptoms Depend on the Severity and Rate of Blood Loss:**

    *   **Mild Blood Loss (Up to 15% of Blood Volume):**
        *   May be asymptomatic
        *   Mild lightheadedness or dizziness
    *   **Moderate Blood Loss (15-30% of Blood Volume):**
        *   Tachycardia (increased heart rate)
        *   Tachypnea (increased respiratory rate)
        *   Pallor (pale skin)
        *   Diaphoresis (sweating)
        *   Orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure upon standing)
    *   **Severe Blood Loss (30-40% of Blood Volume):**
        *   Marked tachycardia and tachypnea
        *   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
        *   Restlessness or anxiety
        *   Oliguria (decreased urine output)
        *   Cool, clammy skin
    *   **Life-Threatening Blood Loss ( >40% of Blood Volume):**
        *   Severe hypotension
        *   Altered mental status (confusion, lethargy)
        *   Anuria (no urine output)
        *   Loss of consciousness
        *   Shock (hypovolemic shock)
*   **Signs of Internal Hemorrhage:**

    *   Abdominal pain and distension
    *   Chest pain
    *   Back pain
    *   Blood in the stool (melena or hematochezia)
    *   Vaginal bleeding

## **Laboratory Findings** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**

    *   *Initial CBC may appear normal!* This is because all blood components (RBCs, WBCs, platelets, and plasma) are lost proportionally
    *   Changes become apparent as the body attempts to restore blood volume:
        *   Hemoglobin (HGB): Decreases over time (usually within hours) as fluid shifts occur
        *   Hematocrit (HCT): Decreases over time (HCT lags behind HGB changes)
        *   Red Blood Cell Count (RBC): Decreases over time
        *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): Initially normal (normocytic) but may become microcytic over time if chronic blood loss leads to iron deficiency
        *   Platelet Count: May initially increase due to splenic contraction, but can decrease with prolonged bleeding or consumptive coagulopathy (DIC)
        *   White Blood Cell Count (WBC): May initially increase due to stress response

*   **Reticulocyte Count:**

    *   Increases within 2-3 days as the bone marrow responds to the anemia
    *   Peaks at 7-10 days

*   **Coagulation Studies:**

    *   Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): Usually normal initially unless there is an underlying coagulation disorder or consumptive coagulopathy (DIC)
    *   Fibrinogen: May be normal or decreased (in DIC)
    *   D-dimer: May be elevated (especially if there is associated activation of the coagulation system or fibrinolysis)

*   **Iron Studies:**

    *   Initially normal
    *   With chronic blood loss, iron deficiency can develop, leading to:
        *   Low serum iron
        *   High Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC)
        *   Low Transferrin Saturation
        *   Low Ferritin

*   **Other Tests:**

    *   Stool occult blood test: To detect gastrointestinal bleeding
    *   Blood type and crossmatch: To prepare for potential blood transfusions
    *   Imaging studies (e.g., CT scan, ultrasound, angiography): To identify the source of bleeding

## **Compensatory Mechanisms in Response to Acute Hemorrhage** {-}

1.  **Vasoconstriction:**
    *   Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes constriction of blood vessels, helping to maintain blood pressure
    *   Shunts blood flow to vital organs (e.g., heart, brain)
2.  **Increased Heart Rate (Tachycardia):**
    *   Increases cardiac output to compensate for reduced blood volume
3.  **Fluid Shifts:**
    *   Movement of interstitial fluid into the vascular space to increase blood volume
    *   This hemodilution leads to a decrease in HGB and HCT
4.  **Hormonal Responses:**
    *   Release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland, promoting water retention by the kidneys
    *   Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to sodium and water retention and vasoconstriction
5.  **Increased Erythropoiesis:**
    *   Kidneys sense decreased oxygen delivery and increase production of erythropoietin (EPO)
    *   EPO stimulates the bone marrow to increase RBC production, leading to reticulocytosis

## **Treatment of Acute Hemorrhage** {-}

*   **Assess the Severity of Blood Loss:**

    *   Evaluate vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate)
    *   Assess mental status and urine output
*   **Stop the Bleeding:**

    *   Apply direct pressure to external wounds
    *   Surgical intervention may be needed to control internal bleeding
*   **Restore Blood Volume and Oxygen-Carrying Capacity:**

    *   Intravenous Fluids:
        *   Crystalloids (e.g., normal saline, lactated Ringer's solution) to restore blood volume
    *   Blood Transfusions:
        *   Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase hemoglobin and improve oxygen delivery
        *   Transfusion triggers depend on the patient's clinical condition and underlying comorbidities
            *   Typically, transfuse when HGB < 7 g/dL or if the patient is symptomatic (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath)
            *   Higher transfusion thresholds may be used in patients with cardiac or pulmonary disease
        *   Consider other blood products as needed:
            *   Platelets for thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction
            *   Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulation factor deficiencies
            *   Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen deficiency
*   **Address Underlying Cause:**

    *   Treat peptic ulcers, esophageal varices, or other sources of bleeding
    *   Correct coagulation disorders
*   **Monitor for Complications:**

    *   Hypovolemic shock
    *   Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
    *   Acute kidney injury (AKI)
    *   Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

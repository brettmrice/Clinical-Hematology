# Chronic Disease {-}

## **Overview of Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Anemia associated with chronic inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions
*   **Alternative Name:** Anemia of Inflammation
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Typically normocytic and normochromic, but can be microcytic in some cases
    *   Characterized by impaired iron utilization and decreased red blood cell production
*   **Prevalence:** Second most common cause of anemia worldwide, after iron deficiency anemia

**Etiology and Associated Conditions**

*   **Chronic Inflammatory Conditions:**
    *   Rheumatoid arthritis
    *   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
    *   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
    *   Chronic infections: Tuberculosis (TB), HIV, osteomyelitis

*   **Malignancies:**
    *   Cancer
    *   Lymphoma
    *   Multiple myeloma

*   **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):**
    *   Decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production
    *   Accumulation of uremic toxins

*   **Chronic Heart Failure:**
    *   Reduced renal perfusion and EPO production
    *   Inflammatory cytokines

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

*   **Iron Dysregulation:**
    *   **Hepcidin:** A key hormone in iron regulation, produced by the liver
        *   In ACD, chronic inflammation leads to increased hepcidin production
        *   Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, the iron export protein found on enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes
        *   Binding of hepcidin to ferroportin causes ferroportin internalization and degradation, which:
            *   Inhibits iron absorption in the gut
            *   Blocks the release of iron from macrophages (where iron is recycled from senescent RBCs)
            *   Traps iron in hepatocytes
        *   Result: Decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis, despite adequate iron stores
    *   **Iron-Restricted Erythropoiesis:**
        *   Limited iron availability impairs hemoglobin synthesis, leading to decreased RBC production
        *   Erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow are unable to acquire sufficient iron for hemoglobin production

*   **Decreased Erythropoietin (EPO) Production and Response:**
    *   **Suppressed EPO Production:**
        *   Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, TNF-α) can suppress EPO production in the kidneys
    *   **Impaired EPO Response:**
        *   Inflammatory cytokines can also blunt the response of erythroid progenitors to EPO
        *   Mechanisms may involve interference with EPO receptor signaling

*   **Shortened Red Blood Cell Survival:**
    *   Inflammatory cytokines can increase red blood cell destruction, leading to a slightly shortened RBC lifespan

## **Clinical Manifestations** {-}

*   **Symptoms of Anemia:**
    *   Fatigue
    *   Weakness
    *   Pallor (pale skin)
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Dizziness
*   **Symptoms of Underlying Condition:**
    *   The clinical presentation is often dominated by the symptoms of the underlying chronic disease (e.g., joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis, diarrhea and abdominal pain in IBD)

## **Diagnostic Evaluation** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Hemoglobin (HGB): Decreased (typically mild to moderate anemia)
    *   Hematocrit (HCT): Decreased
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): Usually normal (normocytic) but can be low (microcytic) in some cases, especially in long-standing ACD or when coexisting with iron deficiency
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): Usually normal (normochromic)
    *   Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW): Usually normal
    *   Reticulocyte Count: Low or normal (inappropriately low for the degree of anemia)
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
    *   Usually normocytic and normochromic
    *   May show mild anisocytosis (variation in RBC size) and poikilocytosis (variation in RBC shape)
*   **Iron Studies:**
    *   Serum Iron: Low
    *   Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC): Normal or low
    *   Transferrin Saturation: Normal or low
    *   Ferritin: Normal or elevated (this helps distinguish ACD from iron deficiency anemia)
*   **Markers of Inflammation:**
    *   Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): Elevated
    *   C-Reactive Protein (CRP): Elevated
    *   Other inflammatory markers: IL-6, TNF-α
*   **Other Tests:**
    *   Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level: May be low or inappropriately normal for the degree of anemia
    *   Tests to evaluate underlying chronic conditions:
        *   Rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibodies (for rheumatoid arthritis)
        *   Antinuclear antibody (ANA) (for SLE)
        *   Stool studies, colonoscopy (for IBD)
        *   Chest X-ray, sputum culture (for TB)
    *   Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:
        *   May be performed to rule out other causes of anemia or to evaluate for MDS

## **Differential Diagnosis** {-}

*   **Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA):**
    *   Microcytic, hypochromic anemia with low serum iron, high TIBC, low transferrin saturation, and low ferritin
*   **Thalassemia:**
    *   Microcytic anemia with normal or elevated iron studies and abnormal hemoglobin electrophoresis
*   **Sideroblastic Anemia:**
    *   Microcytic or normocytic anemia with elevated serum iron and ferritin, and ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow
*   **Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease:**
    *   Normocytic anemia with low EPO level and evidence of kidney dysfunction
*   **Aplastic Anemia:**
    *   Pancytopenia (decreased RBCs, WBCs, and platelets) and hypocellular bone marrow

## **Treatment and Management** {-}

*   **Treat the Underlying Condition:**
    *   The primary goal is to treat the underlying inflammatory, infectious, or malignant disease
    *   Effective treatment of the underlying condition may improve the anemia

*   **Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs):**
    *   Epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa
    *   May be used to stimulate red blood cell production, especially in patients with CKD or cancer-related anemia
    *   Use ESAs cautiously due to potential side effects:
        *   Increased risk of thromboembolic events (blood clots)
        *   Increased mortality in some cancer patients
        *   ESAs are typically used when hemoglobin levels are below 10 g/dL and other causes of anemia have been ruled out
    *   Iron supplementation is often necessary to ensure an adequate response to ESAs

*   **Iron Supplementation:**
    *   Oral iron supplementation is generally not effective in ACD due to hepcidin-mediated iron restriction
    *   Intravenous (IV) iron may be considered in selected patients who are iron-deficient or who are receiving ESAs
    *   Monitor iron studies to avoid iron overload

*   **Blood Transfusions:**
    *   Reserved for patients with severe anemia and significant symptoms
    *   Goal is to alleviate symptoms and improve oxygen delivery to tissues

*   **Novel Therapies:**
    *   Hepcidin antagonists:
        *   Inhibit hepcidin activity, promoting iron release and improving erythropoiesis
    *   Inhibition of inflammatory cytokines:
        *   Targeting IL-6 or TNF-α to reduce inflammation and improve iron utilization

    *   Mild to moderate anemia (low HGB and HCT)
    *   Usually normocytic and normochromic (normal MCV and MCHC)

# Inhibitors {-}

## **Overview of Coagulation Inhibitors** {-}

*   **Definition:** Substances that interfere with the normal function of coagulation factors, leading to impaired thrombin generation and an increased risk of bleeding or, in some cases, thrombosis
*   **Classification:**
    *   Acquired Inhibitors: Antibodies (usually IgG) that develop against specific coagulation factors or phospholipid-binding proteins
    *   Congenital Inhibitors: Rare, inherited deficiencies of natural anticoagulant proteins (Protein C, Protein S, Antithrombin). These are typically categorized as hypercoagulable states rather than factor deficiencies
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Prolonged clotting time (PT and/or aPTT) that does not correct upon mixing with normal plasma (demonstrates the presence of an inhibitor)
    *   May target specific coagulation factors or phospholipid-binding proteins
    *   Clinical manifestations range from bleeding to thrombosis, depending on the specific inhibitor and underlying mechanism

## **Acquired Coagulation Inhibitors** {-}

These are antibodies that develop against coagulation factors or phospholipid-binding proteins, interfering with their function

*   **Factor VIII Inhibitors (Acquired Hemophilia A):**

    *   **Definition:** Autoantibodies (usually IgG) that develop against Factor VIII (FVIII), leading to FVIII deficiency and a bleeding disorder
    *   **Etiology:**
        *   Idiopathic (most common)
        *   Associated with:
            *   Autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE, rheumatoid arthritis)
            *   Pregnancy
            *   Malignancies
            *   Medications (e.g., penicillin, sulfonamides)
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   Autoantibodies bind to FVIII and neutralize its activity or accelerate its clearance from the circulation
        *   Leads to impaired thrombin generation and increased risk of bleeding
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Bleeding manifestations similar to hemophilia A
            *   Easy bruising
            *   Prolonged bleeding after cuts or surgery
            *   Nosebleeds
            *   Hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints) - less common than in inherited hemophilia A
            *   Intracranial hemorrhage (rare but life-threatening)
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   CBC: Normal platelet count
        *   Prothrombin Time (PT): Normal
        *   Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): Prolonged
        *   Mixing Study: aPTT *does not* correct upon mixing with normal plasma (demonstrates the presence of an inhibitor)
        *   Factor VIII Assay: Decreased FVIII activity level
        *   Factor VIII Inhibitor Assay (Bethesda Assay or Nijmegen-Bethesda Assay): Measures the titer (concentration) of the FVIII inhibitor
            *   The Bethesda titer is expressed in Bethesda Units (BU)
            *   One BU is defined as the amount of inhibitor that neutralizes 50% of FVIII in normal plasma
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Control of Bleeding Episodes:
            *   Bypassing agents:
                *   Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs)
                *   Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa)
            *   These agents promote thrombin generation independently of FVIII
        *   Eradication of the Inhibitor:
            *   Immunosuppressive Therapy:
                *   Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone)
                *   Cyclophosphamide
                *   Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody)
            *   Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI): High-dose FVIII infusions combined with immunosuppressive therapy
        *   Avoid FVIII Concentrates (unless necessary to control bleeding)
            *   Repeated exposure to FVIII can boost the inhibitor titer

*   **Lupus Anticoagulant (LA):**

    *   **Definition:** Autoantibodies that bind to phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins, interfering with phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays in vitro
    *   **Etiology:**
        *   Primary (idiopathic)
        *   Secondary: Associated with:
            *   Autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE)
            *   Infections
            *   Medications
            *   Malignancies
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   Antibodies bind to phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins (e.g., prothrombin, β2-glycoprotein I)
        *   Interferes with the assembly of coagulation complexes on phospholipid surfaces *in vitro*, leading to prolonged clotting times
        *   In vivo, the LA can promote thrombosis through complex mechanisms involving:
            *   Activation of endothelial cells and platelets
            *   Decreased production of prostacyclin
            *   Inhibition of natural anticoagulant pathways
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Paradoxical: Despite prolonging clotting times in vitro, LA is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (both arterial and venous)
        *   Thrombotic events:
            *   Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
            *   Pulmonary embolism (PE)
            *   Stroke
            *   Recurrent pregnancy loss
        *   May be asymptomatic
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   Screening Test:
            *   Prolonged aPTT: Most common finding, but PT may also be prolonged in some cases
        *   Mixing Study:
            *   aPTT *does not* correct upon mixing with normal plasma (demonstrates the presence of an inhibitor)
        *   Confirmatory Tests:
            *   Phospholipid-Dependent Coagulation Assays:
                *   Dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT): Prolonged and does not correct with the addition of phospholipid
                *   Silica Clotting Time (SCT): Prolonged and does not correct with the addition of phospholipid
            *   Hexagonal Phase Phospholipid Neutralization Assay:
                *   Demonstrates that the prolonged clotting time is due to a phospholipid-dependent inhibitor
                *   Clotting time corrects when hexagonal phase phospholipids are added to the test system
        *   Anticardiolipin Antibodies and Anti-β2 Glycoprotein I Antibodies:
            *   Often present, but not required for the diagnosis of LA
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Anticoagulation:
            *   Warfarin (Coumadin)
            *   Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be used in some cases, but there is less data on their effectiveness in patients with LA
            *   The intensity and duration of anticoagulation depend on the severity of the thrombosis and the presence of other risk factors
        *   Antiplatelet Therapy:
            *   Aspirin may be used in some patients to reduce the risk of arterial thrombosis
        *   Management of Obstetric Complications:
            *   Low-dose aspirin and prophylactic heparin during pregnancy to prevent recurrent pregnancy loss

*   **Factor V Inhibitors**
    *   Very rare, but when it happens results in prolonged PT and PTT

## **Overview of Manual Cell Counts** {-}

*   **Definition:** Manual cell counts are performed by trained laboratory personnel using a microscope and a specialized counting chamber (hemocytometer) to enumerate cells in a fluid sample
*   **Clinical Significance:** Although automated cell counters are now commonly used, manual cell counts remain important in certain situations:
    *   When automated cell counts are inaccurate or unavailable
    *   For counting cells in body fluids where automated methods may not be validated
    *   To confirm abnormal results obtained by automated methods
*   **Fluids Analyzed:**
    *   Whole Blood: Red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets
    *   Body Fluids: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synovial fluid, serous fluids (pleural, peritoneal, pericardial), and others

## **Principles of Manual Cell Counting** {-}

*   **Dilution:** The sample is diluted with a specific diluent to reduce the cell concentration to a manageable level
*   **Counting Chamber (Hemocytometer):** A specialized glass slide with a precisely ruled grid of known dimensions The Neubauer counting chamber is the most common type
*   **Microscopy:** A microscope is used to visualize the cells within the counting chamber
*   **Cell Identification:** Cells are identified based on their morphology and staining characteristics
*   **Calculation:** The cell count per unit volume is calculated using a formula that takes into account the dilution factor, the area of the counting chamber, and the depth of the chamber

## **Equipment and Materials** {-}

*   **Microscope:** With a calibrated eyepiece and 10x and 40x objectives
*   **Counting Chamber (Hemocytometer):** Neubauer chamber is most common
*   **Coverslip:** A special coverslip designed for use with the counting chamber to create a known volume above the counting grid
*   **Pipettes:** Accurate pipettes for measuring the sample and diluent
*   **Diluent:** An appropriate diluent for the specific cell type being counted:
    *   WBC Count: Acetic acid (3%) or Turk's solution (lyses red blood cells)
    *   RBC Count: Isotonic saline (0.85% NaCl)
    *   Platelet Count: Ammonium oxalate (1%) or sodium citrate (3.8%)
    *   Body Fluid Cell Counts: Isotonic saline (0.85% NaCl) or crystal violet stain
*   **Tally Counter:** A manual or electronic tally counter to keep track of the cells being counted

## **Procedure for Manual Cell Counts** {-}

*   **Sample Preparation:**
    1.  Mix the Sample: Ensure that the blood or body fluid sample is well-mixed
    2.  Prepare the Dilution:
        *   Use a calibrated pipette to accurately measure the sample and diluent
        *   Prepare the appropriate dilution according to established laboratory procedures
            *   WBC Count: Typically a 1:20 or 1:100 dilution
            *   RBC Count: Typically a 1:200 dilution
            *   Platelet Count: Typically a 1:100 dilution
            *   Body Fluid Cell Counts: May require no dilution or up to a 1:20 dilution, depending on the cell concentration
        *   Mix the sample and diluent thoroughly
    3.  Allow to Stand: For WBC counts using a lytic diluent, allow the mixture to stand for at least 10 minutes to allow the red blood cells to lyse

*   **Charging the Counting Chamber:**
    1.  Clean the Hemocytometer and Coverslip: Use lens paper to thoroughly clean the hemocytometer and coverslip
    2.  Position the Coverslip: Carefully place the coverslip on the hemocytometer, ensuring that it is properly seated and covers the counting area
    3.  Charge the Counting Chamber: Gently introduce a small amount of the diluted sample into the counting chamber by capillary action. Avoid overfilling or introducing air bubbles
    4.  Allow Cells to Settle: Allow the cells to settle for a few minutes before counting

*   **Microscopic Examination and Counting:**
    1.  Position the Counting Chamber: Place the hemocytometer on the microscope stage and secure it with the clips
    2.  Focus: Use the 10x objective to focus on the counting grid
    3.  Counting Rules: Follow consistent counting rules to avoid over- or undercounting cells:
        *   Count cells that touch the upper and left-hand boundaries of the counting area
        *   Do not count cells that touch the lower and right-hand boundaries
        *   Count cells within the defined area of the counting chamber
    4.  Counting Patterns:
        *   Systematically count the cells within the designated squares of the counting chamber
        *   Use a consistent counting pattern (e.g., serpentine pattern) to ensure that all cells are counted
    5.  WBC Count: Count the cells in the four large corner squares of the Neubauer chamber
    6.  RBC Count: Count the cells in the five small squares within the central large square of the Neubauer chamber
    7.  Platelet Count: Count the platelets in the twenty-five small squares within the central large square of the Neubauer chamber
    8.  Body Fluid Cell Counts: Count the cells in all nine large squares of the Neubauer chamber
    9.  Record the Counts: Use a tally counter to keep track of the number of cells counted
    10. Perform Duplicate Counts: Perform duplicate counts on a second chamber to assess precision

*   **Calculation of Results:**

    1.  Apply the Appropriate Formula: The formula for calculating the cell count depends on the dilution factor and the area and depth of the counting chamber
        *   General Formula:
            Cell Count (cells/μL) = (Number of Cells Counted x Dilution Factor) / (Area Counted (mm2) x Depth of Chamber (mm))
        *   Specific Formulas (Neubauer Chamber):
            *   WBC Count:
                Cell Count (cells/μL) = (Number of Cells Counted x Dilution Factor) / (4 mm2 x 0.1 mm)
            *   RBC Count:
                Cell Count (cells/μL) = (Number of Cells Counted x Dilution Factor) / (0.2 mm2 x 0.1 mm)
            *   Platelet Count:
                Cell Count (cells/μL) = (Number of Cells Counted x Dilution Factor) / (1.0 mm2 x 0.1 mm)
            *   Body Fluid Cell Counts:
                Cell Count (cells/μL) = (Number of Cells Counted x Dilution Factor) / (9 mm2 x 0.1 mm)
    2.  Average Duplicate Counts: If duplicate counts were performed, calculate the average of the two counts
    3.  Report the Result: Report the cell count in the appropriate units (e.g., cells/μL)

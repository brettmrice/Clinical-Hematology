# Myeloid Neoplasia {-}

## **Overview of Myeloid Neoplasms** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of hematologic malignancies originating from clonal hematopoietic stem cells or early progenitor cells of the myeloid lineage in the bone marrow
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   Abnormal Proliferation: Uncontrolled growth of myeloid cells
    *   Dysplasia: Abnormal cell maturation and morphology
    *   Variable Differentiation: Some myeloid neoplasms primarily involve immature cells (blasts), while others involve more mature cells
    *   Risk of Transformation: Many myeloid neoplasms can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
*   **Classification:** The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is used to categorize myeloid neoplasms based on clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features
*   **General Categories:**
    *   Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
    *   Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
    *   Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs)
    *   Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia and Defining Genetic Abnormalities
    *   Myeloid Sarcoma

## **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Aggressive hematologic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of ≥20% myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Genetic mutations block myeloid differentiation, leading to a buildup of immature blasts
    *   Blasts crowd out normal hematopoietic cells, causing cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
*   **Classification:**
    *   AML with Recurrent Genetic Abnormalities: AML with specific chromosomal translocations or gene mutations (e.g., AML with t(8;21), AML with t(15;17), AML with NPM1 mutation, AML with FLT3-ITD)
    *   AML with Myelodysplasia-Related Changes: AML arising from or associated with a prior myelodysplastic syndrome
    *   Therapy-Related AML: AML arising as a late complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy
    *   AML Not Otherwise Specified (AML-NOS): AML that does not meet the criteria for the other categories and is classified based on morphology and cytochemistry

## **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, dysplasia in one or more cell lines, and a variable risk of progression to AML
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Genetic mutations impair the differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic cells, leading to cytopenias and dysplasia
    *   Dysplastic cells are prone to apoptosis (programmed cell death), contributing to ineffective hematopoiesis
*   **Classification:**
    *   Based on morphological features, cytogenetic abnormalities, and blast percentage in the bone marrow and peripheral blood
    *   Key subtypes include:
        *   Refractory Anemia (RA)
        *   Refractory Anemia with Ring Sideroblasts (RARS)
        *   Refractory Cytopenia with Multilineage Dysplasia (RCMD)
        *   Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts (RAEB-1 and RAEB-2)
        *   MDS with Isolated del(5q)

## **Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by the overproduction of one or more myeloid cell lines in the bone marrow
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Increased Blood Cell Counts: Elevated WBC count, RBC count, and/or platelet count
    *   Splenomegaly: Enlargement of the spleen due to extramedullary hematopoiesis and increased workload
    *   Risk of Thrombosis and Bleeding: Due to abnormal platelet function or elevated blood cell counts
    *   Risk of Transformation: Can progress to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia
*   **Classification:**
    *   Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): Characterized by the presence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene
    *   Polycythemia Vera (PV): Primarily involves increased RBC production; associated with the JAK2 V617F mutation
    *   Essential Thrombocythemia (ET): Primarily involves increased platelet production; associated with mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL
    *   Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF): Characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, and extramedullary hematopoiesis; associated with mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL

## **General Laboratory Features** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential:** To assess the number and types of blood cells, as well as to assess for any abnormalities such as cytopenias or increased numbers of blasts
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:** To evaluate the morphology of blood cells and identify any qualitative abnormalities (e.g., dysplasia)
*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:** To assess the cellularity and morphology of the bone marrow, as well as to detect any dysplasia or abnormal cell populations
*   **Cytogenetic Analysis:** To identify chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations, deletions, or inversions
*   **Flow Cytometry:** To identify cell surface markers and classify blood cells
*   **Molecular Testing:** To detect gene mutations (e.g., JAK2, CALR, MPL, FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA) and fusion genes (e.g., BCR-ABL1)

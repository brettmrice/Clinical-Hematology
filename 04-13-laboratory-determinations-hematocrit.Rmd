# Hematocrit {-}

## **Overview of Hematocrit (HCT)** {-}

*   **Definition:** The hematocrit is the percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells (RBCs). It's a simple but valuable measurement in assessing a patient's red blood cell status
*   **Alternate Names:** Packed Cell Volume (PCV)
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Detection and Monitoring of Anemia: Low HCT indicates anemia (decreased red blood cell mass)
    *   Detection of Polycythemia/Erythrocytosis: High HCT indicates increased red blood cell mass
    *   Assessment of Dehydration: Can be elevated in dehydration due to decreased plasma volume
    *   Monitoring Fluid Balance: Helps assess changes in blood volume
*   **Methods:**
    *   Manual Methods: Centrifugation of blood in a capillary tube (microhematocrit method)
    *   Automated Methods: Calculated by automated hematology analyzers based on RBC count and MCV

## **Manual Microhematocrit Method** {-}

*   **Principle:**

    *   Whole blood is collected in a capillary tube coated with an anticoagulant (usually heparin)
    *   The tube is centrifuged to pack the red blood cells at the bottom of the tube
    *   The height of the packed red blood cell column is measured and compared to the total height of the blood column to determine the hematocrit percentage
*   **Materials:**

    *   Capillary Tubes:
        *   Glass or plastic capillary tubes (typically 75 mm long with an internal diameter of 1-2 mm)
        *   Coated with an anticoagulant (heparin)
    *   Centrifuge:
        *   A specialized centrifuge designed to hold and spin capillary tubes at high speeds
        *   Should be capable of generating a relative centrifugal force (RCF) of at least 10,000 g
    *   Reader:
        *   A device for accurately measuring the height of the packed red blood cell column and the total blood column in the capillary tube
        *   Can be a microhematocrit reader card or a digital reader
    *   Sealing Clay:
        *   Used to seal one end of the capillary tube after filling

*   **Procedure:**

    1.  Sample Collection:
        *   Collect whole blood in an EDTA (purple-top) tube
        *   Capillary blood (fingerstick or heelstick) can also be used, but is less accurate
    2.  Filling the Capillary Tube:
        *   Mix the blood sample thoroughly
        *   Hold the capillary tube horizontally and touch one end to the blood sample
        *   Allow the tube to fill by capillary action to at least 2/3 of its length
        *   Avoid introducing air bubbles into the tube
    3.  Sealing the Tube:
        *   Wipe the outside of the capillary tube clean
        *   Seal one end of the tube with sealing clay to prevent leakage during centrifugation
    4.  Centrifugation:
        *   Place the filled and sealed capillary tubes into the microhematocrit centrifuge
        *   Centrifuge for the recommended time (typically 5 minutes) at the specified RCF (10,000-12,000 g)
    5.  Reading the Hematocrit:
        *   Remove the capillary tubes from the centrifuge
        *   Carefully place the tube on the microhematocrit reader
        *   Align the bottom of the packed red blood cell column with the 0% line on the reader
        *   Align the top of the plasma layer with the 100% line on the reader
        *   Read the hematocrit value at the interface between the packed red blood cells and the plasma
    6.  Record and Report Results:
        *   Record the hematocrit value as a percentage (%)
        *   Report the result along with the reference range
        *   Perform duplicate measurements and average the results (if duplicate results are within acceptable limits)

*   **Sources of Error in Manual Hematocrit Measurement:**

    *   Improper Sealing of the Capillary Tube: Can lead to leakage and falsely low results
    *   Inadequate Centrifugation: Insufficient packing of red blood cells can lead to falsely low results
    *   Delay in Reading: Prolonged delay after centrifugation can lead to cell settling and inaccurate readings
    *   Air Bubbles: Air bubbles in the capillary tube can interfere with the reading
    *   Incorrect Use of the Reader: Not aligning the tube properly on the reader can lead to inaccurate results
    *   Excess Anticoagulant: Overfilling a capillary tube with a blood sample in an anticoagulant collection tube is not recommended

## **Automated Hematocrit Measurement** {-}

*   **Principle:**

    *   Automated hematology analyzers typically calculate the hematocrit based on the red blood cell count and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
    *   Formula: HCT = (RBC Count x MCV) / 10
*   **Procedure:**

    *   The automated analyzer aspirates a small amount of the whole blood sample
    *   The RBC count and MCV are measured using electrical impedance, optical scatter, or other methods
    *   The hematocrit is calculated using the formula above
*   **Advantages:**

    *   Increased Speed and Efficiency
    *   Improved Accuracy and Precision
    *   Reduced Labor Costs
*   **Limitations:**

    *   Can be affected by certain interfering substances or conditions (see below)
    *   Does not directly measure the packed cell volume; it is a calculated value

## **Interfering Substances and Conditions** {-}

Several factors can interfere with both manual and automated hematocrit measurements, leading to inaccurate results. It's crucial to be aware of these interferences and take appropriate corrective actions:

*   **Lipemia:**
    *   Turbidity from high lipid content can falsely elevate the hemoglobin reading, which can affect the calculated hematocrit
    *   Corrective Action: Perform a saline replacement procedure or use a lipemia clearing agent
*   **High White Blood Cell Count (Leukocytosis):**
    *   Extreme leukocytosis can cause falsely elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit readings
    *   Corrective Action: Dilute the sample and multiply the results by the dilution factor
*   **Cold Agglutinins:**
    *   These antibodies can cause RBCs to clump together, leading to inaccurate cell counts and hematocrit measurement
    *   Corrective Action: Warm the sample to 37°C to dissociate the agglutinins
*   **Abnormal Red Blood Cell Size or Shape:**
    *   Spherocytes, schistocytes, and other abnormally shaped RBCs can affect the accuracy of both manual and automated hematocrit measurements
*   **High Hemoglobin (Results beyond the linearity of the instrument)**
    *   Dilute the blood so that the Hgb result is within the linear range of the instrument

## **Quality Control (QC)** {-}

*   **Calibrate the Instruments:**

    *   Perform regular calibration of the microhematocrit centrifuge and automated hematology analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions
*   **Run Control Materials:**

    *   Run control materials at regular intervals (e.g., daily, with each batch of samples)
    *   Use controls that are appropriate for the types of samples being analyzed (e.g., whole blood controls)
*   **Review Control Results:**

    *   Review control results and evaluate them using statistical methods (e.g., Levey-Jennings charts, Westgard rules)
    *   Take corrective action if control results are outside the acceptable range
*   **Check the Rule of Three:**

    *   Verify that the hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC count are consistent with each other, using the "Rule of Three":
        *   HGB x 3 = HCT (± 3)
    *   If the Rule of Three is not met, investigate potential errors

*   Report the hematocrit value as a percentage (%)

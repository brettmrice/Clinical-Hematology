# Fibrinolytic {-}

## **Overview of the Fibrinolytic System** {-}

*   **Definition:** The fibrinolytic system is responsible for the breakdown and removal of fibrin clots from blood vessels once tissue repair has occurred
*   **Purpose:** To restore normal blood flow, prevent excessive clot formation, and maintain vascular patency
*   **Key Components:**
    *   Plasminogen
    *   Plasmin
    *   Plasminogen Activators
    *   Plasmin Inhibitors
    *   Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs)
*   **Disorders:** Can be caused by:
    *   Deficiency or dysfunction of components of the fibrinolytic system
    *   Excessive activation or inhibition of fibrinolysis

## **Disorders of the Fibrinolytic System** {-}

*   **Excessive Fibrinolysis (Hyperfibrinolysis)**

    *   **General Features:** Leads to increased breakdown of fibrin clots and a bleeding tendency
    *   **Common Causes:**
        *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):
            *   A complex disorder characterized by widespread activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis
            *   DIC can lead to excessive fibrinolysis due to the consumption of coagulation factors and the release of plasminogen activators
        *   Liver Disease:
            *   Impaired synthesis of α2-antiplasmin (the main inhibitor of plasmin) can lead to unopposed plasmin activity
        *   Malignancy:
            *   Certain cancers (e.g., acute promyelocytic leukemia) can release tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), leading to excessive fibrinolysis
        *   Streptokinase or tPA Therapy:
            *   Overuse or inappropriate use of thrombolytic agents can lead to excessive fibrinolysis
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Bleeding: Oozing from IV sites, surgical wounds, and mucosal surfaces
        *   Thrombosis: Can also occur due to the underlying cause (e.g., malignancy)
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   Prolonged PT and aPTT: Due to consumption of coagulation factors
        *   Decreased Fibrinogen Level: Due to plasmin degradation
        *   Elevated D-dimer: A specific marker for cross-linked fibrin degradation
        *   Elevated FDPs: Other fibrin degradation products are also increased
        *   Decreased α2-Antiplasmin Level: In some cases of severe fibrinolysis
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Treat the Underlying Cause: Essential for resolving the hyperfibrinolytic state
        *   Supportive Care: Transfusions (platelets, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate) to replace consumed coagulation factors and platelets
        *   Antifibrinolytic Agents:
            *   Aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid: Inhibit plasminogen activation and reduce fibrinolysis
            *   Used with caution, as they can promote thrombosis if the underlying cause is not addressed

*   **Impaired Fibrinolysis (Hypofibrinolysis)**

    *   **General Features:** Leads to decreased breakdown of fibrin clots and an increased risk of thrombosis
    *   **Causes:**
        *   Deficiency of Plasminogen: Rare inherited disorder
        *   Deficiency of tPA or uPA: Rare inherited disorder
        *   Elevated Levels of PAI-1: More common; can be acquired or inherited
            *   Acquired: Associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and certain inflammatory conditions
            *   Inherited: Rare mutations in the PAI-1 gene
        *   Thrombophilia: Inherited or acquired conditions that increase the risk of thrombosis (e.g., factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation)
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Increased Risk of Thrombosis:
            *   Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
            *   Pulmonary embolism (PE)
            *   Arterial thrombosis (stroke, myocardial infarction)
        *   May be asymptomatic until a thrombotic event occurs
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   Routine coagulation tests (PT and aPTT): Usually normal
        *   D-dimer: May be normal or slightly elevated
        *   Plasminogen Activity Assay: Decreased in plasminogen deficiency
        *   tPA and PAI-1 Assays: May show decreased tPA or increased PAI-1 levels
        *   Thrombophilia Testing: To evaluate for other inherited or acquired thrombotic risk factors
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Anticoagulation:
            *   Warfarin (Coumadin)
            *   Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban
        *   Thrombolytic Therapy:
            *   Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to dissolve acute thrombi
        *   Management of Underlying Risk Factors:
            *   Lifestyle modifications (e.g., weight loss, exercise)
            *   Control of underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hyperlipidemia)

## **Laboratory Testing for Disorders of Fibrinolysis** {-}

*   **D-dimer Assay:**

    *   Measures the level of D-dimer in the blood
    *   A negative D-dimer result can be used to rule out VTE in low-risk patients
*   **Fibrinogen Level:**

    *   Measures the amount of fibrinogen in the blood
    *   Decreased in DIC and severe liver disease
*   **tPA and PAI-1 Assays:**

    *   Measure the levels of tPA and PAI-1 in the blood
    *   Used to evaluate fibrinolytic capacity
*   **Plasminogen Activity Assay:**

    *   Measures the activity of plasminogen in the blood
    *   Decreased in plasminogen deficiency
*   **Euglobulin Lysis Time:**

    *   Global assessment of fibrinolytic activity
    *   Prolonged lysis time indicates impaired fibrinolysis

# Hypercoagulability {-}

## **Overview of Hypercoagulability Assessment** {-}

*   **Definition:** Laboratory testing performed to identify inherited and acquired factors that increase the risk of thrombosis (blood clots)
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Evaluate patients with:
        *   Unexplained venous thromboembolism (VTE): Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)
        *   Arterial thrombosis in young individuals or at unusual sites
        *   Recurrent thrombosis
        *   Family history of thrombosis
        *   Recurrent pregnancy loss
    *   Guide management decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   Testing is not indicated for all patients with thrombosis
    *   The decision to perform thrombophilia testing should be based on clinical judgment and consideration of the patient's risk factors
    *   Testing should generally be performed *after* an acute thrombotic event has resolved and the patient is *not* on anticoagulant therapy (or after anticoagulation has been discontinued for several weeks), as anticoagulants can interfere with the results

## **Assays for Assessing Hypercoagulability** {-}

These tests evaluate the function or levels of various components of the coagulation system

*   **Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) Testing:**

    *   *Principle:* A series of phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays that detect the presence of lupus anticoagulants (LA), which are autoantibodies that interfere with phospholipid-dependent coagulation reactions in vitro

*   **Protein C Activity Assay:**

    *   *Principle:* Measures the activity of protein C, a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein
        *   Protein C is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on endothelial cells
        *   Activated protein C (APC), along with its cofactor protein S, inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa, inhibiting thrombin generation

*   **Protein S Activity and Antigen Assays:**

    *   *Principle:* Measures the activity and amount of protein S, a cofactor for activated protein C
        *   Protein S exists in two forms in plasma:
            *   Free Protein S: The active form that acts as a cofactor for APC
            *   Bound Protein S: Bound to C4b-binding protein

*   **Antithrombin Activity and Antigen Assays:**

    *   *Principle:* Measures the activity and amount of antithrombin (AT), a natural anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin and other coagulation factors

## **Molecular Testing for Inherited Thrombophilias** {-}

*   **Factor V Leiden Mutation Analysis:**

    *   *Principle:* Detects the presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation (R506Q) in the *F5* gene

*   **Prothrombin G20210A Mutation Analysis:**

    *   *Principle:* Detects the presence of the prothrombin G20210A mutation in the *F2* gene

## **Considerations for Testing and Interpretation** {-}

*   **Clinical Context:** Interpret test results in the context of the patient's clinical history, medication use, and other laboratory findings
*   **Testing Timing:** Perform thrombophilia testing when the patient is not acutely thrombotic and is not on anticoagulant therapy (or after anticoagulation has been discontinued for several weeks)
*   **Sequential Testing:** Follow a logical testing algorithm to evaluate for thrombophilia
*   **Repeat Testing:** Repeat positive results for antiphospholipid antibodies (LA, aCL, anti-β2GPI) at least 12 weeks apart to confirm persistence
*   **Heterozygous vs. Homozygous:** A test that can help distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous mutations, but it is not required.
*   **Reference Ranges:** Use appropriate reference ranges for the patient's age and sex
*   **Quality Control:** Follow established laboratory procedures and quality control guidelines

## **Algorithm for Thrombophilia Testing** {-}

(This is a general guideline. Always follow your laboratory's specific protocol)

1.  Clinical Suspicion of Thrombophilia
2.  Initial Testing:
    *   PT and aPTT (to screen for coagulation abnormalities)
    *   Platelet Count
3.  If aPTT is Prolonged, Consider Lupus Anticoagulant Testing
4.  If Thrombophilia Testing is Warranted (and Patient is Not Acutely Thrombotic or Anticoagulated):
    *   Factor V Leiden Mutation Analysis
    *   Prothrombin G20210A Mutation Analysis
    *   Protein C Activity and Antigen Assays
    *   Free Protein S Antigen and Total Protein S Antigen Assays
    *   Antithrombin Activity and Antigen Assays
    *   Antiphospholipid Antibody Testing (LA, aCL, anti-β2GPI)
5. Interpret Results:
    *   Interpret the results in the context of the patient's clinical presentation and other laboratory findings
    *   Refer to a hematologist or thrombosis specialist for further evaluation and management

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Hypercoagulable State (Thrombophilia):** A condition with an increased risk of thrombosis
*   **Factor V Leiden:** A common genetic mutation that causes resistance to activated protein C
*   **Prothrombin G20210A Mutation:** A genetic mutation that leads to increased prothrombin levels
*   **Protein C:** A vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein
*   **Protein S:** A cofactor for activated protein C
*   **Antithrombin:** A serine protease inhibitor that inhibits thrombin and other coagulation factors
*   **Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):** An autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, and antiphospholipid antibodies
*   **Lupus Anticoagulant (LA):** An antibody that interferes with phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays
*   **Thrombosis:** Formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel

# Macrocytic {-}

## **Macrocytic Anemias** {-}

*   **Characteristics:** Large RBCs (MCV > 100 fL)
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Megaloblastic Anemias:**
        *   Impaired DNA synthesis due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
        *   Peripheral blood smear: Oval macrocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils (more than 5 lobes)
        *   Lab findings:
            *   Low vitamin B12 or folate levels
            *   Elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine levels (in B12 deficiency)
            *   Elevated homocysteine levels (in folate deficiency)
        *   Causes of B12 deficiency:
            *   Pernicious anemia (autoimmune destruction of parietal cells in the stomach, leading to decreased intrinsic factor)
            *   Malabsorption (e.g., Crohn's disease, celiac disease)
            *   Dietary deficiency (rare)
        *   Causes of Folate Deficiency:
            *   Inadequate intake (e.g., poor diet, alcoholism)
            *   Malabsorption
            *   Increased demand (e.g., pregnancy, hemolytic anemia)
            *   Medications (e.g., methotrexate)
    *   **Non-Megaloblastic Anemias:**
        *   Macrocytosis without hypersegmented neutrophils
        *   Causes:
            *   Alcoholism
            *   Liver disease
            *   Hypothyroidism
            *   Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
            *   Reticulocytosis (increased number of reticulocytes due to hemolysis or blood loss)
            *   Medications (e.g., hydroxyurea)

## **Laboratory Tests for Anemia** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Hemoglobin (HGB)
    *   Hematocrit (HCT)
    *   Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)
    *   Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)
    *   White Blood Cell Count (WBC) and Differential
    *   Platelet Count
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
    *   RBC morphology (size, shape, color)
    *   WBC differential
    *   Platelet estimate
*   **Reticulocyte Count:**
    *   Percentage and absolute number of reticulocytes
    *   Corrected Reticulocyte Count/Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI)
*   **Iron Studies:**
    *   Serum Iron
    *   Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC)
    *   Transferrin Saturation
    *   Ferritin
*   **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:**
    *   Serum B12
    *   Red Blood Cell Folate
*   **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) and Homocysteine Levels:**
    *   Elevated in B12 Deficiency
    *   Homocysteine also Elevated in Folate Deficiency
*   **Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:**
    *   Identifies abnormal hemoglobin variants (e.g., HbS, HbC)
*   **Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT):**
    *   Detects antibodies or complement proteins on the surface of RBCs
*   **Bone Marrow Examination:**
    *   Cellularity
    *   Maturation of cell lines
    *   Presence of abnormal cells
*   **Other Tests:**
    *   Haptoglobin and LDH (for hemolysis)
    *   Coombs test (for autoimmune hemolytic anemia)
    *   Osmotic Fragility Test (for hereditary spherocytosis)
    *   G6PD Assay (for G6PD deficiency)

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Anemia:** Deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin
*   **Macrocytic:** Large red blood cells (MCV > 100 fL)
*   **Reticulocyte:** Immature red blood cell
*   **Hemolysis:** Destruction of red blood cells
*   **Extramedullary Hematopoiesis:** Blood cell production outside the bone marrow
*   **Megaloblastic:** Abnormal maturation of blood cells due to impaired DNA synthesis

## **Overview of Molecular Testing in Hypercoagulability Assessment** {-}

*   **Purpose:** Molecular testing is performed to identify genetic mutations that are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (hypercoagulable state)
*   **When to Consider Molecular Testing:**
    *   Unexplained or recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE)
    *   VTE at a young age (<50 years)
    *   Family history of thrombophilia
    *   Thrombosis in unusual sites (e.g., mesenteric, cerebral)
    *   Recurrent pregnancy loss
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   Molecular testing is generally performed *after* an acute thrombotic event has resolved and the patient is *not* on anticoagulant therapy
    *   The decision to perform molecular testing should be based on clinical judgment and consideration of the patient's risk factors and the likelihood of finding a clinically significant mutation
    *   A positive result on molecular testing does not guarantee that the patient will develop thrombosis, but it can provide useful information for risk stratification and management decisions

## **Key Molecular Tests** {-}

Here's a detailed breakdown of the common molecular tests used to assess inherited thrombophilias:

*   **Factor V Leiden Mutation Analysis (F5 Gene):**

    *   *Background:* Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited thrombophilia

*   **Prothrombin G20210A Mutation Analysis (F2 Gene):**

    *   *Background:* The second most common inherited thrombophilia

## **General Molecular Testing Procedures** {-}

Regardless of the specific mutation being tested, the general procedure for molecular testing involves:

1.  DNA Extraction: Extract DNA from a blood sample
2.  PCR Amplification: Use PCR to amplify the region of the gene that contains the mutation
3.  Mutation Detection: Use various techniques to detect the presence of the mutation:

*   Allele-Specific PCR (AS-PCR): Uses primers that are specific for the mutated sequence
*   Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) Analysis: Uses restriction enzymes to cut the DNA at specific sites, creating fragments of different lengths depending on the presence or absence of the mutation
*   Real-Time PCR: Uses fluorescent probes to detect the amplified DNA product and quantify the amount of the mutated sequence
*   Next Generation Sequencing: If negative for Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin, then this is a good option. This can test many other mutations associated with thrombophilia

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Thrombophilia (Hypercoagulable State):** A condition with an increased risk of thrombosis
*   **Factor V Leiden:** A common genetic mutation that causes resistance to activated protein C
*   **Prothrombin G20210A Mutation:** A genetic mutation that leads to increased prothrombin levels
*   **Mutation:** A change in the DNA sequence of a gene

# Thromboelastography {-}

## **Overview of Thromboelastography (TEG)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are viscoelastic hemostatic assays that provide a comprehensive assessment of hemostasis, including:
    *   Coagulation: The formation of fibrin clot
    *   Platelet Function: The contribution of platelets to clot strength
    *   Fibrinolysis: The breakdown of the clot
*   **Principle:**
    *   Whole Blood Analysis: TEG analyzes the entire coagulation process in whole blood, providing a more comprehensive assessment of hemostasis than traditional plasma-based coagulation tests (PT and aPTT)
    *   Viscoelastic Measurements: Measures the viscoelastic properties of the developing clot over time, including:
        *   Clot Strength
        *   Clotting Time
        *   Fibrinolysis
    *   Dynamic Assessment: Provides a dynamic assessment of clot formation and breakdown, reflecting the interactions between coagulation factors, platelets, and fibrinolytic proteins
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Assessment of Bleeding Risk: Helps identify patients at risk of bleeding during surgery or other invasive procedures
    *   Goal-Directed Hemostatic Therapy: Guides the use of blood products and hemostatic agents in bleeding patients
    *   Monitoring Anticoagulation: Can be used to monitor the effects of anticoagulants
    *   Diagnosis of Coagulation Disorders: Can help identify inherited or acquired coagulation disorders
    *   Assessment of Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy: Useful for assessing coagulopathy in trauma patients
*   **Instruments:**
    *   Thromboelastograph (TEG): Older technology, measures the movement of a pin suspended in a cup of whole blood
    *   Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM): Newer technology, measures the rotation of a pin suspended in a cup of whole blood

## **Components of the TEG/ROTEM System** {-}

*   **Instrumentation:**
    *   TEG or ROTEM Analyzer: The instrument that performs the viscoelastic measurements
    *   Cups and Pins: Disposable cups and pins that are used to hold the blood sample and measure clot formation
    *   Pipettes: Accurate pipettes for measuring reagents and samples
    *   Temperature Control: System to maintain the sample at a constant temperature (typically 37°C)
*   **Reagents:**
    *   Activators: Reagents that activate the coagulation cascade
        *   Kaolin: A contact activator that initiates the intrinsic pathway
        *   Tissue Factor (TF): Activates the extrinsic pathway
        *   Ellagic Acid: Activates the contact pathway
    *   Inhibitors (Optional): Used to assess specific components of the coagulation system
        *   Cytochalasin D: Inhibits platelet function
        *   Aprotinin: Inhibits fibrinolysis
    *   Quality Control Materials: Commercially available control materials are used to monitor the performance of the instrument
*   **Sample Preparation:**

    *   Whole Blood Collection:
        *   Collect whole blood in a specialized tube recommended by the manufacturer (typically a citrate tube with a specific formulation)
        *   Ensure that the tube is filled to the correct volume to maintain the proper blood-to-anticoagulant ratio
        *   Gentle Mixing: Gently invert the collection tube 5-10 times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant
    *   Timely Analysis:
        *   Test the sample within the timeframe recommended by the manufacturer (typically within 1-4 hours of collection)
        *   Store the sample at room temperature (22-25°C) until testing

## **Procedure for Performing TEG/ROTEM** {-}

1.  Sample Preparation:
    *   Follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions for sample preparation
    *   Ensure that the blood sample is well-mixed and free of clots
    
2.  Reagent Preparation:
    *   Prepare the reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Ensure that the reagents are properly stored and are not expired
    
3.  Instrument Setup:
    *   Turn on the instrument and allow it to warm up
    *   Load the appropriate cups and pins into the instrument
    *   Enter the patient information and test order into the instrument software
    
4.  Running the Assay:
    *   Pipette a specific volume of the whole blood sample into the cup
    *   Add the appropriate activator (e.g., kaolin or tissue factor) to the sample
    *   Start the test and allow the instrument to perform the analysis
    *   The instrument will continuously monitor the viscoelastic properties of the developing clot and generate a TEG or ROTEM tracing

## **Interpreting TEG/ROTEM Results** {-}

*   **Key Parameters:**

    *   R (Reaction Time):
        *   The time from the start of the test until the first evidence of clot formation (initial fibrin formation)
        *   Represents the activity of the coagulation factors
        *   Prolonged R: Indicates a deficiency or inhibition of coagulation factors
    *   K (Clot Formation Time):
        *   The time from the end of R until the clot reaches a certain level of strength
        *   Represents the rate of fibrin clot formation
        *   Prolonged K: Suggests a deficiency or dysfunction of fibrinogen
    *   α (Alpha Angle):
        *   The angle between the R and K parameters
        *   Reflects the speed of clot formation
        *   Decreased Alpha Angle: Suggests a deficiency or dysfunction of fibrinogen or platelets
    *   MA (Maximum Amplitude):
        *   The maximum strength of the clot, reflecting the interaction of platelets and fibrin
        *   Represents the contribution of platelets to clot strength
        *   Low MA: Suggests thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction
    *   CI (Clotting Index):
        *   A global measure of hemostasis
    *   LY30 (Lysis at 30 Minutes):
        *   The percentage decrease in clot amplitude 30 minutes after MA
        *   Reflects the degree of fibrinolysis
        *   Increased LY30: Suggests hyperfibrinolysis

*   **Interpretation Based on Specific Clinical Scenarios:**

    *   Bleeding Patient:
        *   Prolonged R: Factor deficiency (e.g., hemophilia)
        *   Prolonged K or Decreased α: Fibrinogen deficiency or dysfunction
        *   Low MA: Thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction
        *   Increased LY30: Hyperfibrinolysis (e.g., DIC)
    *   Thrombotic Patient:
        *   Shortened R and K: Hypercoagulability
        *   Increased MA: Increased platelet reactivity
        *   Decreased LY30: Impaired fibrinolysis
    *   Monitoring Anticoagulation:
        *   Heparin: Prolonged R and K, normal MA and LY30
        *   Direct Thrombin Inhibitors: Prolonged R and K, normal MA and LY30
        *   Fibrinolytic Agents: Increased LY30

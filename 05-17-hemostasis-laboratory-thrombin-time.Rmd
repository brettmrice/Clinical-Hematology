# Thrombin Time {-}

## **Overview of Thrombin Time (TT)** {-}

*   **Definition:** The thrombin time (TT), also known as the thrombin clotting time (TCT), is a coagulation test that measures the time (in seconds) it takes for a clot to form in plasma after the addition of thrombin
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Assess the final common pathway of coagulation, specifically the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin
    *   Detect quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of fibrinogen
    *   Detect the presence of thrombin inhibitors (e.g., heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, fibrin degradation products)
*   **Principle:**
    *   Thrombin is added to plasma, bypassing the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation
    *   The rate of clot formation depends on the concentration and function of fibrinogen, as well as the presence of any thrombin inhibitors

## **Components of the Thrombin Time Test** {-}

*   **Specimen Collection:**

    *   Collection Tube: Sodium citrate (light blue top) tube with a 3.2% or 3.8% sodium citrate concentration
    *   Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: The correct ratio is critical for accurate coagulation testing:
        *   9:1 ratio of blood to anticoagulant
        *   Underfilling the tube can lead to falsely prolonged clotting times due to excess anticoagulant
        *   Overfilling the tube can lead to falsely shortened clotting times due to insufficient anticoagulant

*   **Reagents:**

    *   Thrombin Reagent: A solution of purified thrombin
        *   The concentration of thrombin is carefully controlled to ensure consistent results
    *   Calcium Chloride: Provides calcium ions, which are essential for the thrombin-fibrinogen reaction
    *   Buffer: Tris buffer or other suitable buffer to maintain a stable pH

*   **Instrumentation:**

    *   Automated Coagulation Analyzer: Detects clot formation using optical or mechanical methods:
        *   Optical Method: Measures changes in light transmission as the clot forms
        *   Mechanical Method: Detects the movement of a probe or wire as the clot forms

## **Procedure for Performing the Thrombin Time Test** {-}

1.  Sample Preparation:
    *   Centrifuge the sodium citrate tube to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
    *   PPP should have a platelet count < 10 x 10^9/L

2.  Automated Method:
    *   Follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions
    *   Incubate the plasma at 37Â°C
    *   Add the thrombin reagent to the plasma
    *   Measure the time to clot formation (TT in seconds)

3.  Quality Control:
    *   Run control materials at regular intervals to assess the accuracy and precision of the test
    *   Review control results and take corrective action if necessary

## **Interpreting Results** {-}

*   **Thrombin Time (TT):**
    *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the reagent and instrument used (e.g., 9-13 seconds)
    *   Prolonged Thrombin Time: Indicates a deficiency or dysfunction of fibrinogen or the presence of thrombin inhibitors
        *   Hypofibrinogenemia: Decreased levels of fibrinogen
        *   Dysfibrinogenemia: Abnormal fibrinogen molecule that does not clot properly
        *   Heparin: Inhibits thrombin activity
        *   Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (DTIs): Dabigatran, argatroban, bivalirudin
        *   Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs): Can interfere with fibrin polymerization
        *   Amyloidosis: Causes fibrin to form large, poorly formed clots

## **Factors Affecting Thrombin Time Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**

    *   Improper Collection Technique: Tissue thromboplastin contamination or hemolysis
    *   Incorrect Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: Underfilling or overfilling the collection tube
    *   Clotted Sample: Invalidates the results
    *   Delayed Testing: Fibrinogen can degrade over time
    *   Improper Storage: Incorrect storage temperatures can affect results

*   **Analytical Variables:**

    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the coagulation analyzer
    *   Reagent Problems: Use fresh, properly stored reagents and follow the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Interfering Substances: High levels of paraproteins (e.g., in multiple myeloma) can interfere with clot detection

*   **Patient-Related Variables:**

    *   Medications: Heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, and other anticoagulants
    *   Liver Disease: Impairs the synthesis of fibrinogen
    *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Consumption of fibrinogen
    *   Inherited Fibrinogen Disorders: Afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the thrombin time result is inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation or previous results:

    *   Check the sample for clots or hemolysis
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Ensure that the correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio was used
    *   Verify the instrument and reagent quality control results
    *   Investigate potential interfering substances
    *   Review the patient's medication list and medical history
    *   Consider performing additional tests to investigate fibrinogen abnormalities (see below)

## **Reflex Testing** {-}

*   If the thrombin time is prolonged, further testing may be performed to determine the cause of the prolongation:

    *   Reptilase Time: Measures the time it takes for a clot to form after the addition of reptilase (an enzyme that cleaves fibrinogen)
        *   Normal Reptilase Time: Suggests the presence of heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor
        *   Prolonged Reptilase Time: Suggests a deficiency or dysfunction of fibrinogen
    *   Fibrinogen Assay: Measures the concentration of fibrinogen in the plasma
        *   Low Fibrinogen: Suggests hypofibrinogenemia or afibrinogenemia
        *   Normal Fibrinogen: Suggests dysfibrinogenemia or the presence of a thrombin inhibitor
    *   Thrombin Inhibitor Assay: To detect and quantify thrombin inhibitors

## **Overview of Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping** {-}

*   **Definition:** A powerful and versatile technique that allows for the identification, characterization, and quantification of cells based on their expression of specific cell surface markers (antigens)
*   **Principle:**
    *   Cells are labeled with fluorescently labeled antibodies that bind to specific cell surface or intracellular antigens
    *   The labeled cells are passed through a laser beam in a flow cytometer
    *   The instrument measures the amount of light scattered and fluorescence emitted by each cell
    *   The data are analyzed to identify and quantify different cell populations
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Diagnosis and Classification of Hematologic Malignancies: Essential for diagnosing and classifying leukemias and lymphomas
    *   Monitoring Minimal Residual Disease (MRD): Used to detect small numbers of residual cancer cells after treatment
    *   Assessment of Immune Function: Used to enumerate lymphocyte subsets (e.g., CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells) and assess immune cell activation
    *   Diagnosis of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): Detects deficiency of GPI-linked proteins on blood cells
    *   Transplant Monitoring: Used to assess chimerism and detect graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

## **Basic Principles of Flow Cytometry** {-}

1.  **Sample Preparation:**
    *   Whole Blood or Bone Marrow Aspirate: Samples are collected in EDTA (purple-top) tubes or heparin tubes
    *   Cell Separation: RBCs are lysed to remove them, and the remaining cells are washed and resuspended in buffer

2.  **Antibody Labeling:**
    *   Antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies specific for different cell surface or intracellular antigens are used
    *   Fluorochromes: Each antibody is conjugated to a fluorescent dye (fluorochrome) that emits light at a specific wavelength when excited by a laser
    *   Antibody Combinations: Multiple antibodies with different fluorochromes are often used simultaneously to identify multiple markers on the same cell (multicolor flow cytometry)
    *   Incubation: The cells are incubated with the antibody cocktail, allowing the antibodies to bind to their target antigens

3.  **Flow Cytometry Analysis:**
    *   Flow Cell: The labeled cells are passed through a flow cell in a single stream
    *   Laser Excitation: A laser beam illuminates the cells as they pass through the flow cell
    *   Light Scatter: The instrument measures:
        *   Forward Scatter (FSC): Proportional to cell size
        *   Side Scatter (SSC): Proportional to cell granularity and internal complexity
    *   Fluorescence Detection: Detectors measure the intensity of fluorescence emitted by each fluorochrome

4.  **Data Analysis:**
    *   Gating: Cell populations are identified and gated based on their FSC and SSC properties
        *   Sequential Gating: The cells are first gated based on FSC and SSC to isolate the population of interest (e.g., lymphocytes, blasts), and then further gated based on the expression of specific markers
        *   "Backgating": Starting with the specific population and looking to the source based on side and forward scatter.
    *   Data Display: Data are typically displayed as dot plots or histograms, showing the expression of different markers on each cell population
    *   Quadrant Statistics: Quadrant markers are placed on dot plots to divide the cell population into four quadrants, and the percentage of cells in each quadrant is calculated
        *   Allows quantification of cells that are positive or negative for two different markers

## **Applications of Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping** {-}

*   **Leukemia and Lymphoma Diagnosis and Classification**

    *   Acute Leukemias:
        *   Lineage Assignment
        *   Subtyping of AML
    *   Chronic Lymphoproliferative Disorders
    *   Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Monitoring

*   **Lymphocyte Subset Analysis**

    *   CD4+ T Cell Count
    *   CD8+ T Cell Count
    *   B Cell Quantification
    *   NK Cell Quantification

*   **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)**

## **Quality Control** {-}

*   **Instrument Calibration and Standardization:**
    *   Regular calibration of the flow cytometer to ensure accurate and reproducible results
    *   Use of standardized reagents and protocols
*   **Compensation:**
    *   Correction for spectral overlap between different fluorochromes
    *   Using compensation controls to set appropriate compensation values
*   **Gating Strategies:**
    *   Use consistent and reproducible gating strategies
    *   Include appropriate controls to identify and exclude non-specific staining

## **Factors Affecting Accuracy** {-}

*   **Sample Handling:**
    *   Collect blood in EDTA (purple-top) tubes
    *   Process samples within 24 hours of collection to minimize cell degradation

*   **Antibody Selection:**
    *   Use high-quality, well-characterized antibodies
    *   Select antibodies that are known to be sensitive and specific for GPI-linked proteins

*   **Instrument Calibration:**
    *   Perform daily instrument calibration and quality control procedures

*   **Compensation:**
    *   Properly compensate for spectral overlap between different fluorochromes

*   **Gating Strategy:**
    *   Use a consistent and well-defined gating strategy to accurately identify cell populations

*   **Data Analysis:**
    *   Ensure that the data analysis is performed by trained personnel

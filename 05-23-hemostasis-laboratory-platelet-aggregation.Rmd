# Platelet Aggregation {-}

## **Overview of Platelet Aggregation Studies** {-}

*   **Definition:** Platelet aggregation studies are *in vitro* tests that measure the ability of platelets to aggregate (clump together) in response to various agonists
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Diagnosis of Platelet Function Disorders: Helps identify inherited or acquired disorders of platelet function
    *   Evaluation of Unexplained Bleeding: Used to investigate patients with a personal or family history of mucocutaneous bleeding
    *   Assessment of Antiplatelet Therapy: Used to monitor the effects of antiplatelet medications (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel)
    *   Research: Used to study platelet physiology and pharmacology
*   **Key Principle:** Measures the change in light transmission through a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) sample as platelets aggregate
*   **Agonists Used:** Different agonists stimulate platelet aggregation via different pathways, allowing for the assessment of specific platelet functions:
    *   Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP)
    *   Collagen
    *   Epinephrine
    *   Arachidonic Acid (AA)
    *   Ristocetin
    *   Thrombin Receptor-Activating Peptide (TRAP)

## **Components of Platelet Aggregation Studies** {-}

*   **Specimen Collection:**

    *   Collection Tube: Sodium citrate (light blue top) tube with a 3.2% or 3.8% sodium citrate concentration. It is very important to use the correct sodium citrate concentration and to fill the collection tube all the way to the fill line.
    *   Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: The correct ratio is critical for accurate coagulation testing:
        *   9:1 ratio of blood to anticoagulant
    *   Collection Technique: Atraumatic venipuncture to avoid platelet activation
    *   Transport and Storage: Transport the sample to the laboratory promptly (within 30 minutes).
        *   Maintain the sample at room temperature (18-24°C)
        *   Do not refrigerate or freeze the sample
    *   Patient Preparation:
        *   Medication Restrictions: Patients should avoid taking aspirin or other antiplatelet medications for at least 7-10 days before testing

*   **Reagents:**

    *   Platelet Aggregating Agents (Agonists): ADP, collagen, epinephrine, arachidonic acid, ristocetin, thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP)
    *   Platelet-Poor Plasma (PPP): Used as a blank to calibrate the aggregometer and as a reference for 100% light transmission
    *   Saline or Buffer: Used to dilute reagents and samples
    *   Quality Control Materials: Commercially available control materials or pooled normal plasma may be used to monitor the performance of the assay

*   **Instrumentation:**

    *   Platelet Aggregometer: A specialized instrument that measures platelet aggregation by monitoring changes in light transmission through a stirred suspension of platelet-rich plasma
    *   Components of an Aggregometer:
        *   Light Source: Provides a beam of light that passes through the sample
        *   Cuvette Holder: Holds the sample cuvette
        *   Stirring Mechanism: Continuously stirs the sample to maintain a homogenous suspension of platelets
        *   Detector: Measures the amount of light transmitted through the sample
        *   Recording Device: Records the change in light transmission over time, generating an aggregation curve

## **Procedure for Performing Platelet Aggregation Studies** {-}

1.  Prepare Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP):
    *   Centrifuge the sodium citrate whole blood sample at a low speed (e.g., 150-200 g) for 10-20 minutes to obtain PRP
    *   Carefully remove the PRP layer without disturbing the RBC layer
2.  Adjust Platelet Count:
    *   Adjust the platelet count in the PRP to a standardized level (typically 200-300 x 10^9/L) by adding autologous platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
    *   Accurate platelet count adjustment is critical for obtaining reliable and reproducible results
3.  Prepare Reagents:
    *   Dilute the platelet aggregating agents (agonists) to the appropriate concentrations according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Warm the reagents to room temperature
4.  Run the Assay:
    *   Pipette a specific volume of PRP into a cuvette
    *   Place the cuvette in the aggregometer
    *   Allow the sample to equilibrate at 37°C for a specific period (e.g., 2-5 minutes)
    *   Add the agonist to the PRP
    *   Start the stirring mechanism and the recording device
    *   Monitor the change in light transmission over time

## **Interpreting Results** {-}

*   **Aggregation Curve:**

    *   The aggregometer records the change in light transmission over time, generating an aggregation curve
    *   The curve typically consists of two phases:
        *   Primary Aggregation: Initial wave of aggregation, caused by the agonist-induced shape change and adhesion of single platelets
        *   Secondary Aggregation: Sustained aggregation, caused by the release of mediators from platelet granules (e.g., ADP, thromboxane A2) and activation of additional platelets
        
*   **Parameters Evaluated:**

    *   Maximum Aggregation: The highest percentage of light transmission achieved during the aggregation response
    *   Slope of the Curve: The rate of aggregation
    *   Lag Phase: The time between the addition of the agonist and the start of aggregation
    *   Shape of the Curve: The presence or absence of a secondary wave of aggregation
*   **Normal Aggregation Response:**
    *   Normal aggregation with all agonists (ADP, collagen, epinephrine, arachidonic acid, ristocetin)
*   **Abnormal Aggregation Responses:**

    *   Absent or Reduced Aggregation: Indicates a platelet function defect
        *   May be specific to certain agonists or may affect all agonists
    *   Normal Aggregation with Some Agonists, Abnormal with Others: Suggests a specific defect in a particular platelet activation pathway

## **Specific Patterns of Platelet Aggregation** {-}

*   **Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT):**
    *   Absent or severely reduced aggregation with ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and thrombin
    *   Normal aggregation with ristocetin (because vWF binding to GPIb/IX/V is intact)
*   **Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS):**
    *   Normal aggregation with ADP, collagen, and epinephrine
    *   Absent aggregation with ristocetin (even with added normal plasma)
*   **von Willebrand Disease (vWD):**
    *   Decreased aggregation with ristocetin
    *   Other agonists may show normal or mildly reduced aggregation
*   **Aspirin Effect:**
    *   Normal aggregation with ADP and epinephrine
    *   Absent or reduced aggregation with collagen and arachidonic acid
*   **P2Y12 Inhibitors (e.g., Clopidogrel, Prasugrel):**
    *   Reduced aggregation with ADP
    *   Normal aggregation with other agonists

## **Factors Affecting Platelet Aggregation Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**

    *   Improper Collection Technique: Traumatic venipuncture can activate platelets and affect results
    *   Incorrect Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: Underfilling or overfilling the collection tube can alter the test results
    *   Delayed Testing: Platelet function can change over time, so the test should be performed within the specified timeframe (usually within 2-4 hours of collection)
    *   Storage Temperature: Improper storage temperatures can affect platelet function
*   **Analytical Variables:**

    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the aggregometer
    *   Reagent Problems: Use fresh, properly stored reagents and follow the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Air Bubbles: Air bubbles in the sample can interfere with light transmission
    *   Inadequate Stirring: Proper stirring is essential for maintaining a homogenous suspension of platelets

*   **Patient-Related Variables:**

    *   Medications:
        *   Aspirin and NSAIDs: Inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and impair thromboxane A2 production
        *   P2Y12 Inhibitors: Clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor block the ADP receptor on platelets
        *   GPIIb/IIIa Inhibitors: Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban block the GPIIb/IIIa receptor
    *   Underlying Medical Conditions:
        *   Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs): Platelets may have abnormal function
        *   Uremia (Chronic Kidney Disease): Uremic toxins can impair platelet function
        *   Liver Disease: Can affect platelet function
        *   Certain Infections

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the platelet aggregation results are unexpected or inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation:

    *   Check the sample for clots or air bubbles
    *   Verify that the hematocrit and platelet count are within the acceptable range for the instrument
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Review the patient's medication list and medical history
    *   Ensure that the reagents and controls are within their expiration dates and stored properly
    *   Consider other pre-analytical or analytical factors that may have affected the results

## **Reflex Testing** {-}

*   If platelet aggregation studies are abnormal, additional testing may be performed to:

    *   Identify specific platelet function defects
    *   Flow Cytometry: To measure platelet surface markers (e.g., GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX/V)
    *   Platelet Secretion Assays: To measure the release of substances from platelet granules (e.g., ADP, serotonin)
    *   Electron Microscopy: To examine platelet ultrastructure

# Factor Deficiencies {-}

## **Overview of Coagulation Factor Deficiencies** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of bleeding disorders caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of one or more coagulation factors, which are essential for the normal blood clotting process
*   **Classification:**
    *   Hereditary (Inherited) Coagulation Factor Deficiencies: Genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding coagulation factors
    *   Acquired Coagulation Factor Deficiencies: Caused by external factors that impair coagulation factor synthesis or function
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Bleeding Tendency: The severity of bleeding depends on the specific factor involved and the degree of deficiency
    *   Common Manifestations:
        *   Easy bruising
        *   Prolonged bleeding after cuts, dental procedures, or surgery
        *   Nosebleeds (epistaxis)
        *   Gum bleeding
        *   Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) in women
        *   Hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints)
        *   Intracranial hemorrhage (rare but life-threatening)

## **Hereditary Coagulation Factor Deficiencies** {-}

*   **General Characteristics:**
    *   Inherited in an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive pattern
    *   Often present with bleeding symptoms early in life
    *   Specific diagnosis requires factor assays

*   **Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency):**
    *   *Definition:* An X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of Factor VIII (FVIII)

*   **Hemophilia B (Factor IX Deficiency, Christmas Disease):**
    *   *Definition:* An X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of Factor IX (FIX)

*   **Other Rare Hereditary Factor Deficiencies:**

    *   Factor XI Deficiency (Hemophilia C):
    *   Factor V Deficiency:
    *   Combined Factor V and VIII Deficiency
    *   Factor VII Deficiency:
    *   Factor X Deficiency:
    *   Factor XIII Deficiency:

## **Acquired Coagulation Factor Deficiencies** {-}

*   **Vitamin K Deficiency:**
    *   *Pathophysiology:* Vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on Factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S

*   **Liver Disease:**
    *   *Pathophysiology:* The liver is the primary site of synthesis for most coagulation factors

*   **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):**
    *   *Definition:* A complex disorder characterized by widespread activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, leading to both thrombosis and bleeding

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Coagulation Factors:** Proteins involved in the coagulation cascade
*   **Hemophilia A:** Factor VIII deficiency
*   **Hemophilia B:** Factor IX deficiency
*   **Vitamin K:** A cofactor for the carboxylation of certain coagulation factors
*   **Liver Disease:** Impairs the synthesis of coagulation factors
*   **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):** A consumptive coagulopathy with widespread clotting and bleeding
*   **Prothrombin Time (PT):** Test of the extrinsic and common pathways
*   **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):** Test of the intrinsic and common pathways

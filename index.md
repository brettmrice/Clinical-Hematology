## Author {.unnumbered}

I graduated from Augusta University's Clinical Laboratory Science program in 2013. I worked on the Clinical Hematology bench in Augusta University Medical Center full time between 2013-18. In 2016, I earned my Specialist in Hematology (ASCP). While working, I gained experience on the Bone Marrow and Flow Cytometry bench and was successful on the Specialist in Cytometry (ASCP) in 2018.

Since September of 2018, I have been teaching full time in Augusta University's Clinical Laboratory Science program with a primary teaching focus in Clinical Hematology. I still practice in the same Clinical Hematology, Bone Marrow, and Flow Cytometry Laboratory one day each week.

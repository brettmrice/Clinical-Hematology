# D-dimer {-}

## **Overview of D-dimer Assays** {-}

*   **Definition:** D-dimer assays are quantitative tests used to measure the level of D-dimer in plasma. D-dimer is a specific fibrin degradation product (FDP) that results from the breakdown of cross-linked fibrin
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Exclusion of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): D-dimer assays are primarily used to rule out venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]) in patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability
    *   Diagnosis of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): D-dimer is markedly elevated in DIC
    *   Monitoring Thrombolytic Therapy: Can be used to monitor the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy
    *   Assessment of Other Conditions: Elevated D-dimer levels can also be seen in other conditions, including pregnancy, infection, inflammation, malignancy, and recent surgery
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Poor Specificity: Elevated D-dimer levels are not specific to VTE and can be seen in a variety of other conditions
    *   Age-Related Increase: D-dimer levels tend to increase with age
    *   Not Useful for Monitoring Anticoagulation: D-dimer is not used to monitor anticoagulant therapy

## **Principle of D-dimer Assays** {-}

D-dimer assays are based on immunochemical methods that use monoclonal antibodies specific for D-dimer

*   **Latex Agglutination Assay:**
    *   Latex particles are coated with monoclonal antibodies against D-dimer
    *   When the reagent is mixed with a sample containing D-dimer, the antibodies bind to the D-dimer, causing the latex particles to agglutinate (clump together)
    *   The agglutination is measured turbidimetrically or nephelometrically, and the result is compared to a calibration curve
*   **Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):**
    *   Microplate wells are coated with monoclonal antibodies against D-dimer
    *   The sample is added to the wells, and any D-dimer present binds to the antibodies
    *   A secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme is added, which binds to the D-dimer-antibody complex
    *   A substrate for the enzyme is added, and the resulting color change is measured spectrophotometrically
*   **Immunoturbidimetric Assay:**
    *   Antibodies against D-dimer are added to the sample
    *   As the antibodies bind to D-dimer, immune complexes form
    *   The turbidity of the solution is measured, which is proportional to the D-dimer concentration
*   **Chemiluminescent Immunoassay:**
    *   Similar to ELISA, but uses a chemiluminescent substrate instead of an enzyme-linked substrate
    *   The emitted light is measured, which is proportional to the D-dimer concentration

## **Procedure for Performing D-dimer Assay** {-}

1.  Sample Collection and Preparation:
    *   Collect blood in a sodium citrate (light blue top) tube
    *   Process the sample within the specified timeframe to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for sample storage and handling

2.  Assay Performance:
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific assay being used
    *   Ensure that all reagents are properly prepared and stored
    *   Load the samples and reagents onto the automated analyzer
    *   Start the assay and allow the instrument to perform the analysis

3.  Quality Control:
    *   Run control materials at regular intervals (e.g., daily, with each batch of samples) to assess the accuracy and precision of the assay
    *   Evaluate control results and take corrective action if necessary
4.  Result Calculation:
    *   The automated analyzer calculates the D-dimer concentration based on a calibration curve
    *   Ensure that the results are within the assay's linear range

## **Reporting Results** {-}

*   Report the D-dimer concentration in the appropriate units (e.g., ng/mL, μg/L)
*   Include the reference range for the assay
*   Note any abnormal results or flags
*   Document all quality control procedures and corrective actions taken

## **Interpreting Results** {-}

*   **Negative D-dimer Result:**
    *   D-dimer level is below the established cut-off value for the assay
    *   In patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability for VTE, a negative D-dimer result is used to rule out DVT and PE
*   **Elevated D-dimer Result:**
    *   D-dimer level is above the cut-off value
    *   Indicates the presence of fibrin degradation products in the plasma, suggesting that both coagulation and fibrinolysis have been activated
    *   Causes of Elevated D-dimer:
        *   Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): DVT and PE
        *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
        *   Surgery
        *   Trauma
        *   Pregnancy
        *   Malignancy
        *   Infection
        *   Inflammation
        *   Advanced Age
    *   *Note:* An elevated D-dimer result is *not specific* for VTE, and further testing (e.g., imaging studies) is required to confirm the diagnosis

## **Factors Affecting D-dimer Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**

    *   Improper Sample Collection:
        *   Clotted sample: D-dimer cannot be accurately measured
        *   Underfilled collection tube: Can affect the blood-to-anticoagulant ratio
    *   Delayed Processing:
        *   Prolonged storage at room temperature can lead to falsely elevated D-dimer levels
        *   Samples should be processed and tested as soon as possible or stored according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Lipemia or Icterus:
        *   Can interfere with optical measurements
*   **Analytical Variables:**

    *   Assay Type: Different D-dimer assays have different sensitivities and specificities
    *   Cut-off Values: Cut-off values for positivity can vary between laboratories
    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the analyzer

*   **Patient-Related Variables:**

    *   Age: D-dimer levels tend to increase with age
        *   Age-Adjusted Cut-Offs: Some laboratories use age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off values to improve specificity in older adults
            *   Age-Adjusted Cut-Off = 0.50 μg/mL + (Age x 0.01 μg/mL)
    *   Pregnancy: D-dimer levels are normally elevated during pregnancy
    *   Medical Conditions:
        *   Inflammation
        *   Infection
        *   Malignancy
        *   Liver Disease
        *   Kidney Disease

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the D-dimer result is inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation:

    *   Check the sample for clots, hemolysis, or lipemia
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Ensure that the test was performed within the acceptable timeframe
    *   Consider the possibility of interfering substances
    *   Review the patient's medical history and medication list
    *   Consult with a pathologist or coagulation expert

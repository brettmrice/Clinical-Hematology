# Sideroblastic {-}

## **Overview of Sideroblastic Anemias** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of heterogeneous hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Impaired ability of the bone marrow to incorporate iron into hemoglobin
    *   Iron accumulates in the mitochondria of erythroblasts, forming ringed sideroblasts
    *   Ineffective erythropoiesis leads to anemia
*   **Classification:**
    *   Hereditary Sideroblastic Anemias
    *   Acquired Sideroblastic Anemias
        *   Reversible
        *   Irreversible

## **Etiology and Classification** {-}

*   **Hereditary Sideroblastic Anemias**
    *   **X-Linked Sideroblastic Anemia (XLSA):**
        *   Most common form of hereditary sideroblastic anemia
        *   Caused by mutations in the *ALAS2* gene, which encodes erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2), a key enzyme in heme synthesis
    *   **Autosomal Recessive Sideroblastic Anemias:**
        *   Rare disorders caused by mutations in genes involved in heme synthesis, mitochondrial function, or iron metabolism
        *   Examples: Mutations in the *ABCB7*, *GLRX5*, *HSPA9*, and *SLC25A38* genes
    *   **Mitochondrial Myopathy with Sideroblastic Anemia (MLASA):**
        *   Associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear genes that affect mitochondrial function

*   **Acquired Sideroblastic Anemias**
    *   **Reversible Acquired Sideroblastic Anemias:**
        *   Caused by exposure to certain drugs, toxins, or nutritional deficiencies
        *   Examples:
            *   Alcohol-induced sideroblastic anemia: Alcohol interferes with heme synthesis
            *   Drug-induced sideroblastic anemia: Isoniazid, pyrazinamide, chloramphenicol, and linezolid
            *   Copper deficiency: Copper is required for iron transport and incorporation into heme
            *   Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) deficiency: Vitamin B6 is a cofactor for ALAS2
    *   **Irreversible Acquired Sideroblastic Anemias:**
        *   Associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS):
            *   A group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
            *   Refractory Anemia with Ring Sideroblasts (RARS): A subtype of MDS characterized by anemia and increased ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow
        *   Associated with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN):
            *   A group of disorders characterized by the overproduction of one or more blood cell lines in the bone marrow

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

*   **Impaired Heme Synthesis:**
    *   Mutations or deficiencies affecting enzymes involved in heme synthesis lead to a buildup of porphyrin precursors and impaired iron incorporation into protoporphyrin
    *   In XLSA, mutations in *ALAS2* result in decreased production of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first committed step in porphyrin synthesis
*   **Mitochondrial Dysfunction:**
    *   Defects in mitochondrial function impair iron-sulfur cluster synthesis and other mitochondrial processes essential for heme synthesis
    *   Iron accumulates in the mitochondria, leading to the formation of ringed sideroblasts.
*   **Ringed Sideroblasts:**
    *   Erythroblasts with iron-laden mitochondria encircling the nucleus
    *   The presence of ≥15% ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow is a key diagnostic criterion for sideroblastic anemia
*   **Ineffective Erythropoiesis:**
    *   Accumulation of iron and dysfunctional mitochondria in erythroblasts leads to cellular damage and apoptosis (programmed cell death)
    *   Results in decreased red blood cell production and anemia

## **Clinical Manifestations** {-}

*   **Symptoms of Anemia:**
    *   Fatigue
    *   Weakness
    *   Pallor (pale skin)
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Dizziness
*   **Iron Overload:**
    *   In hereditary sideroblastic anemias and MDS-associated sideroblastic anemias, chronic anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis lead to increased iron absorption
    *   Frequent blood transfusions can also contribute to iron overload
    *   Iron accumulates in various organs, leading to:
        *   Liver damage (cirrhosis)
        *   Heart failure
        *   Endocrine dysfunction (diabetes, hypothyroidism)
        *   Skin pigmentation (bronze diabetes)
*   **Other Symptoms:**
    *   Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen)
    *   Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
    *   Neurological symptoms (in some mitochondrial disorders)

## **Diagnostic Evaluation** {-}

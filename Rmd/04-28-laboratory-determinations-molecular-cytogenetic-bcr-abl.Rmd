# BCR/ABL1 {-}

## **Overview of the *BCR/ABL1* Fusion Gene** {-}

*   **Definition:** The *BCR-ABL1* fusion gene is an abnormal gene formed by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, denoted as t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)
*   **Historical Context:** This translocation results in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph chromosome), named after the city where it was discovered
*   **Significance:**
    *   Diagnostic Marker for CML: The presence of *BCR-ABL1* is the defining characteristic of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
    *   Prognostic Marker: In CML, the level of *BCR-ABL1* transcript is used to monitor treatment response and predict the risk of disease progression
    *   Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker for ALL: Present in some cases of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), particularly adult B-ALL, and is associated with a poorer prognosis
    *   Target for Therapy: The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein is a tyrosine kinase, making it a target for specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)

## **Molecular Basis of the *BCR-ABL1* Fusion Gene** {-}

*   **Normal Genes:**
    *   *ABL1* (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1): Located on chromosome 9 (9q34.1)
        *   Encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival
    *   *BCR* (Breakpoint Cluster Region): Located on chromosome 22 (22q11.2)
        *   Encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in signal transduction
*   **Translocation Process:**
    *   A reciprocal translocation occurs between chromosomes 9 and 22:
        *   Part of the *ABL1* gene from chromosome 9 translocates to the *BCR* gene on chromosome 22
        *   Part of the *BCR* gene from chromosome 22 translocates to chromosome 9
*   **Resulting Fusion Gene:**
    *   The translocation creates a new fusion gene, *BCR-ABL1*, on the Philadelphia chromosome (derivative chromosome 22)
    *   The *BCR-ABL1* fusion gene encodes a 210 kDa protein that has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

*   **Constitutive Tyrosine Kinase Activity:**
    *   The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein has uncontrolled tyrosine kinase activity, meaning it is always "switched on"
    *   This unregulated kinase activity leads to:
        *   Uncontrolled cell proliferation
        *   Inhibition of apoptosis (programmed cell death)
        *   Genomic instability
    *   These effects result in the clonal expansion of malignant myeloid cells (in CML) or lymphoid cells (in Ph+ ALL)
*   **Downstream Signaling Pathways:**
    *   BCR-ABL1 activates multiple downstream signaling pathways, including:
        *   RAS/MAPK pathway
        *   PI3K/AKT pathway
        *   JAK/STAT pathway
    *   These pathways regulate cell growth, survival, and differentiation

## **Laboratory Detection of BCR-ABL1** {-}

*   **Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping):**
    *   *Principle:* Visualizes the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph chromosome) resulting from the t(9;22) translocation
    *   *Procedure:*
        *   Cells are cultured, arrested in metaphase, and stained to visualize the chromosomes
        *   Karyotype is analyzed to identify the Ph chromosome
    *   *Reporting:*
        *   t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   Can detect other chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Ph chromosome
    *   *Limitations:*
        *   Requires viable cells and cell culture
        *   Time-consuming
        *   Cannot detect cryptic translocations or variant translocations

*   **Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH):**
    *   *Principle:* Uses fluorescently labeled DNA probes to detect the *BCR* and *ABL1* genes and the *BCR-ABL1* fusion gene
    *   *Procedure:*
        *   Interphase FISH: Performed on uncultured bone marrow cells
        *   Metaphase FISH: Performed on cultured cells
        *   Hybridization: Fluorescent probes are hybridized to the chromosomes on a slide
        *   Microscopic Examination: The slide is examined under a fluorescence microscope, and the number and location of the fluorescent signals are counted
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   More rapid than karyotyping
        *   Can be performed on non-dividing cells
        *   Can detect cryptic translocations
    *   *Limitations:*
        *   Only detects known chromosomal abnormalities for which probes are available
        *   Cannot detect novel translocations or complex rearrangements

*   **Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR):**
    *   *Principle:* Amplifies and detects the *BCR-ABL1* fusion transcript (mRNA)
    *   *Procedure:*
        1.  RNA Extraction: Extract RNA from bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
        2.  Reverse Transcription: Convert RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase
        3.  Amplification: Use PCR to amplify the *BCR-ABL1* fusion transcript using specific primers
        4.  Detection: Detect the amplified DNA product using gel electrophoresis or real-time PCR
    *   *Qualitative RT-PCR:*

        *   Used for initial diagnosis
    *   *Quantitative Real-Time PCR (RQ-PCR):*

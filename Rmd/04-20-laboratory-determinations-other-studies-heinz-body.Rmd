# Heinz Body {-}

## **Overview of Heinz Body Staining** {-}

*   **Definition:** A histochemical staining technique used to visualize Heinz bodies within red blood cells (RBCs)
*   **What are Heinz Bodies?**
    *   Inclusions within RBCs composed of denatured or precipitated hemoglobin
    *   Formed due to oxidative damage to hemoglobin, causing the globin chains to unfold and aggregate
    *   Not normally visible with Wright-Giemsa stain (the routine stain used for peripheral blood smears)
*   **Clinical Significance:** The presence of Heinz bodies indicates oxidative damage to red blood cells and is associated with several conditions, particularly G6PD deficiency and exposure to certain toxins
*   **Key Principle:** Heinz bodies can only be visualized with supravital stains, which stain living cells, allowing the denatured hemoglobin to precipitate and form visible inclusions

## **Principle of Heinz Body Staining** {-}

*   **Supravital Staining:**
    *   The blood sample is stained *while the cells are still living* (in vitro) using a supravital dye
    *   The supravital stain penetrates the RBCs and binds to the denatured hemoglobin, causing it to precipitate and form Heinz bodies
*   **Staining Mechanism:**
    *   The supravital dye (typically crystal violet or brilliant cresyl blue) interacts with the denatured hemoglobin, causing it to aggregate and precipitate within the RBC
    *   The precipitated hemoglobin forms small, round or irregular inclusions that are visible under a microscope

## **Materials and Reagents** {-}

*   **Whole Blood:** Fresh EDTA (purple-top) or heparin (green-top) whole blood sample
*   **Supravital Stain:**
    *   Crystal Violet Stain:
        *   Crystal violet
        *   Ethanol
    *   Brilliant Cresyl Blue Stain:
        *   Brilliant cresyl blue
        *   Sodium chloride
        *   Distilled water
*   **Glass Slides:** Clean, grease-free microscope slides
*   **Coverslips:**
*   **Test Tubes or Microcentrifuge Tubes:**
*   **Pipettes:** To accurately measure reagents and samples
*   **Incubator or Water Bath:** To maintain a constant temperature during incubation
*   **Microscope:** With oil immersion objective (100x)

## **Procedure** {-}

1.  **Prepare the Stain Solution:**
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions or established laboratory protocols to prepare the crystal violet or brilliant cresyl blue stain solution
    *   Filter the stain solution to remove any particulate matter
2.  **Mix Blood and Stain:**
    *   In a small test tube or microcentrifuge tube, mix equal volumes of whole blood and the supravital stain solution (e.g., 0.5 mL of blood + 0.5 mL of stain)
3.  **Incubate:**
    *   Incubate the mixture at 37°C (98.6°F) for 15-30 minutes. This allows the stain to penetrate the cells and react with the denatured hemoglobin
4.  **Prepare Smears:**
    *   After incubation, gently mix the blood-stain mixture
    *   Prepare thin wedge (push) smears on clean glass slides, similar to preparing a routine peripheral blood smear
5.  **Air Dry:**
    *   Allow the smears to air dry completely at room temperature
    *   *Do not heat-fix the smears*, as heat fixation can distort or destroy the Heinz bodies
6.  **Microscopic Examination:**
    *   Examine the air-dried smears under oil immersion (100x objective)
    *   Select a well-stained area of the smear where the RBCs are evenly distributed and not overlapping
7.  **Identify and Count Heinz Bodies:**
    *   Look for small, round or irregular inclusions within the RBCs
    *   Heinz bodies stain dark blue or purple with crystal violet and dark blue with brilliant cresyl blue
    *   Count the number of Heinz bodies per 100 RBCs (or more, if necessary to obtain an accurate count)
    *   Report the number of Heinz bodies per 100 RBCs (e.g., "5 Heinz bodies per 100 RBCs")

## **Interpretation of Results** {-}

*   **Normal:** No Heinz bodies are seen in normal red blood cells

*   **Heinz Bodies Present:** Indicates oxidative damage to hemoglobin and suggests:
    *   G6PD Deficiency: Exposure to oxidative stressors (e.g., drugs, infections, fava beans) in individuals with G6PD deficiency
    *   Unstable Hemoglobin Variants: Hemoglobin variants that are prone to denaturation
    *   Exposure to Oxidant Drugs or Chemicals: Certain drugs (e.g., dapsone, sulfonamides, phenazopyridine) and chemicals can cause oxidative damage
    *   Splenectomy: The spleen normally removes Heinz bodies from RBCs, so they may be more readily seen in patients who have had a splenectomy

*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   The number of Heinz bodies may vary depending on the severity of the oxidative stress and the time elapsed since the exposure
    *   Heinz bodies are typically removed by the spleen, so they may not be seen in patients with an intact spleen, even if there is evidence of oxidative damage

## **Sources of Error and Troubleshooting** {-}

*   **Poor Smear Preparation:**
    *   Ensure that the smears are thin, evenly distributed, and free of artifacts

*   **Staining Artifacts:**
    *   Use fresh stain solutions and follow proper staining procedures
    *   Avoid prolonged staining or washing times

*   **Improper Microscope Settings:**
    *   Ensure that the microscope is properly aligned and the light source is adequate
    *   Use the correct objective lens (100x oil immersion)

*   **Misidentification of Heinz Bodies:**
    *   Distinguish Heinz bodies from other inclusions (e.g., Howell-Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies) and staining artifacts
    *   Consult a reference atlas or experienced hematologist if needed

*   **Delay in Smear Preparation:**
    *   Prepare smears promptly after mixing the blood with the stain to prevent Heinz bodies from disappearing

## **Reporting Results** {-}

*   Report the presence or absence of Heinz bodies
*   Quantify the number of Heinz bodies per 100 RBCs (if present)
*   Indicate the type of stain used (e.g., crystal violet, brilliant cresyl blue)
*   Include a comment noting any factors that may have affected the results (e.g., recent transfusion, splenectomy)
*   Correlate the results with the patient's clinical information

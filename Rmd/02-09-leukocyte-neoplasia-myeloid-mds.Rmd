## **Overview of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by *ineffective hematopoiesis,* resulting in cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or neutropenia) and a variable risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Dysplasia: Abnormal morphology and maturation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow
    *   Ineffective Hematopoiesis: Increased apoptosis (programmed cell death) of hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow, leading to decreased production of mature blood cells
    *   Cytopenias: One or more peripheral blood cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or neutropenia)
    *   Risk of Transformation: Variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
*   **Epidemiology:** Primarily affects older adults (median age at diagnosis is >65 years)
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Most cases are *de novo* (arising without a known cause)
    *   Some cases are therapy-related (t-MDS), occurring after exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy
    *   Genetic predisposition plays a role in a small number of cases

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

*   **Clonal Hematopoiesis:** MDS arises from a mutated hematopoietic stem cell that has a proliferative advantage over normal stem cells
*   **Genetic Mutations:** Acquired mutations in genes involved in:
    *   Splicing factors (e.g., *SF3B1*, *SRSF2*, *U2AF1*)
    *   DNA methylation (e.g., *TET2*, *DNMT3A*)
    *   Transcription factors (e.g., *RUNX1*, *TP53*)
    *   Signaling pathways (e.g., *RAS* pathway)
*   **Impaired Differentiation:** Mutations disrupt normal differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic cells
*   **Dysplasia:** Abnormal morphological features in one or more cell lines (erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytic)
*   **Increased Apoptosis:** Dysplastic cells are prone to apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the bone marrow, contributing to ineffective hematopoiesis
*   **Cytokine Dysregulation:** Abnormal production of cytokines by bone marrow cells can contribute to ineffective hematopoiesis and cytopenias
*   **Immune Dysregulation:** Abnormal immune responses may contribute to bone marrow failure in some cases

## **WHO Classification of MDS (2016 Revision)** {-}

The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is used to categorize MDS based on:

*   **Morphological Features:** Dysplasia in one or more cell lines, blast percentage
*   **Cytogenetic Abnormalities:** Specific chromosomal abnormalities
*   **Blast Percentage:** Percentage of blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood

Key Subtypes of MDS:

*   **MDS with Single Lineage Dysplasia (MDS-SLD):**
    *   Cytopenia in one cell line (anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia)
    *   Dysplasia in one cell line only
    *   <5% blasts in the bone marrow and <1% blasts in the peripheral blood
*   **MDS with Ring Sideroblasts (MDS-RS):**
    *   Subclassified as:
        *   **MDS-RS-SLD:** Single lineage dysplasia with ≥15% ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow
        *   **MDS-RS-MLD:** Multilineage dysplasia with ≥15% ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow
    *   Cytopenia in one or more cell lines
    *   <5% blasts in the bone marrow and <1% blasts in the peripheral blood
    *   Often associated with *SF3B1* mutation
*   **MDS with Multilineage Dysplasia (MDS-MLD):**
    *   Cytopenia in one or more cell lines
    *   Dysplasia in ≥50% of cells in at least two cell lines
    *   <5% blasts in the bone marrow and <1% blasts in the peripheral blood
*   **MDS with Excess Blasts (MDS-EB):**
    *   Subclassified as:
        *   **MDS-EB-1:** 5-9% blasts in the bone marrow or 2-4% blasts in the peripheral blood
        *   **MDS-EB-2:** 10-19% blasts in the bone marrow or 5-9% blasts in the peripheral blood
    *   Cytopenias in one or more cell lines
    *   May have Auer rods
*   **MDS with Isolated del(5q):**
    *   Anemia
    *   Normal or increased platelet count
    *   <5% blasts in the bone marrow and <1% blasts in the peripheral blood
    *   Isolated del(5q) cytogenetic abnormality
    *   Often responsive to lenalidomide

## **Clinical Manifestations** {-}

*   **Symptoms of Cytopenias:**

    *   Anemia: Fatigue, weakness, pallor, shortness of breath
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Bleeding, bruising, petechiae (small, pinpoint hemorrhages)
    *   Neutropenia: Increased susceptibility to infections

*   **Other Symptoms:**

    *   Some patients are asymptomatic and MDS is found incidentally in the blood test
    *   Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen): Less common than in myeloproliferative neoplasms
    *   Hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen)
    *   Systemic Symptoms (Less Common): Fever, weight loss, night sweats

## **Laboratory Findings** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**

    *   Cytopenias in one or more cell lines (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
        *   May see macrocytosis (increased MCV) or dimorphic RBC population
    *   Variable WBC count (may be low, normal, or high)
    *   Presence of blasts in the peripheral blood (variable, depends on the subtype of MDS)

*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**

    *   Dysplastic Features in One or More Cell Lines:
        *   RBCs: Oval macrocytes, hypochromia, basophilic stippling, Howell-Jolly bodies, teardrop cells
        *   Neutrophils: Pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly (bilobed or unsegmented neutrophils), hypogranulation, abnormal nuclear segmentation
        *   Platelets: Large platelets, abnormal granulation

*   **Reticulocyte Count:**

    *   Low or Normal (inappropriately low for the degree of anemia)

*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:**

    *   Increased Cellularity (Hypercellular) or Decreased Cellularity (Hypocellular)

*   **Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping:**

    *   To Identify Abnormal Cell Populations and Assess for Dysplasia
        *   Aberrant expression of cell surface markers
        *   Abnormal cell ratios
        *   Helps differentiate MDS from other conditions

*   **Molecular Testing:**

    *   To Detect Gene Mutations that are Important for Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment Planning

    *   Used to estimate the prognosis and risk of AML transformation in patients with MDS
    *   Based on:
        *   Percentage of blasts in the bone marrow
        *   Cytogenetic abnormalities
        *   Number of cytopenias
        *   Assigns patients to risk categories: Very low, low, intermediate, high, or very high

## **Treatment and Management** {-}

*   **Goals of Treatment:**

    *   Improve blood counts
    *   Reduce the risk of infections and bleeding
    *   Delay or prevent transformation to AML
    *   Improve quality of life and survival

*   **Treatment Options:**

    *   Supportive Care:
        *   Transfusions (RBCs and platelets) to manage anemia and thrombocytopenia
        *   Growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin, G-CSF) to stimulate blood cell production
        *   Antibiotics to treat infections
        *   Iron chelation therapy to manage iron overload from chronic transfusions (if needed)
    *   Hypomethylating Agents (HMAs):
        *   Azacitidine and decitabine
        *   Inhibit DNA methylation, leading to improved hematopoiesis and reduced risk of AML transformation
        *   Used in higher-risk MDS
    *   Lenalidomide:
        *   An immunomodulatory drug used for patients with MDS with deletion 5q
        *   Effective in reducing transfusion dependence and improving cytopenias
    *   Luspatercept:
        *   A recombinant fusion protein that binds to TGF-β superfamily ligands
        *   Promotes erythroid maturation and reduces transfusion burden in patients with MDS-RS
    *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):
        *   Potentially curative option, especially for younger patients with high-risk MDS
        *   Involves replacing the patient's damaged bone marrow with healthy stem cells from a donor

# Platelet Function {-}

## **Overview of Platelet Function Testing** {-}

*   **Definition:** Platelet function tests are a group of laboratory assays used to evaluate the ability of platelets to perform their role in primary hemostasis (forming the initial platelet plug)
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Diagnosis of Platelet Disorders: Helps identify inherited or acquired disorders of platelet function
    *   Evaluation of Unexplained Bleeding: Used to investigate patients with a personal or family history of mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, easy bruising, prolonged bleeding after minor cuts)
    *   Assessment of Antiplatelet Therapy: Used to monitor the effects of antiplatelet medications (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel)
    *   Preoperative Assessment: Helps assess the risk of bleeding before surgery
*   **Types of Platelet Function Tests:**
    *   Screening Tests:
        *   Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)
    *   Confirmatory Tests:
        *   Platelet Aggregation Studies
        *   Flow Cytometry Assays
        *   Platelet Secretion Assays
        *   Genetic Testing

## **Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   The PFA-100 or PFA-200 systems are *in vitro* assays that simulate high-shear conditions found in small blood vessels
    *   Whole blood is aspirated through a small aperture (hole) in a cartridge coated with a platelet agonist (collagen/epinephrine or collagen/ADP)
    *   As the blood passes through the aperture, platelets adhere to the collagen and are activated by the agonist
    *   The platelets aggregate and eventually occlude the aperture, stopping the flow of blood
    *   The time it takes for the aperture to become occluded is measured and reported as the Closure Time (CT)

*   **Key Components of the PFA System:**

    *   Instrumentation:
        *   PFA-100 or PFA-200 analyzer
    *   Cartridges:
        *   Collagen/Epinephrine (CEPI) Cartridge: Coated with collagen and epinephrine; primarily detects aspirin-related platelet dysfunction
        *   Collagen/ADP (CADP) Cartridge: Coated with collagen and ADP; detects a broader range of platelet function defects
    *   Quality Control Materials:
        *   Normal controls to verify instrument performance

*   **Procedure:**

    1.  Sample Collection:
        *   Collect whole blood in a sodium citrate (light blue top) tube
        *   Ensure that the tube is filled to the correct volume to maintain the proper blood-to-anticoagulant ratio
    2.  Sample Preparation:
        *   Mix the blood sample gently but thoroughly
        *   Test the sample within the specified timeframe (usually within 2-4 hours of collection)
        *   Ensure that the hematocrit and platelet count are within the acceptable range for the instrument
    3.  Cartridge Insertion:
        *   Insert the appropriate PFA cartridge (CEPI or CADP) into the analyzer
    4.  Sample Aspiration:
        *   Aspirate a small amount of the whole blood sample into the analyzer
    5.  Test Initiation:
        *   Start the test and allow the instrument to perform the analysis
        *   The analyzer will measure the time it takes for the aperture to become occluded (Closure Time)
    6.  Quality Control:
        *   Run control materials at regular intervals to verify instrument performance
        *   Document all QC results
    7.  Results:
        *   The instrument reports the Closure Time (CT) in seconds for both the CEPI and CADP cartridges

*   **Reporting and Interpretation:**

    *   Closure Time (CT):
        *   Epinephrine Closure Time (Epi-CT):
        *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the laboratory and the PFA instrument (e.g., 84-169 seconds)
        *   Prolonged Epi-CT: Suggests aspirin-related platelet dysfunction or a severe platelet defect
        *   ADP Closure Time (ADP-CT):
        *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the laboratory and the PFA instrument (e.g., 71-118 seconds)
        *   Prolonged ADP-CT: Suggests a platelet function defect not related to aspirin (e.g., P2Y12 inhibitors, von Willebrand disease, Glanzmann thrombasthenia)

## **Interpreting PFA Results:** {-}
*   What are the normal results?
    *   For the CEPI test - ~84-169 Seconds
    *   For the CADP test - ~71-118 Seconds
        *   **These ranges can vary depending on institution, so please note your institution's specific ranges!**
*   What if they are higher than the normal range?
    *   This could indicate that a patient has been taking platelet inhibitors such as asprin
    *   They could have Von Willebrand Disease
    *   They may have Glanzmann Thrombasthenia

## **Factors Affecting PFA Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**

    *   Sample Collection: Traumatic venipuncture or use of a small-gauge needle can activate platelets and affect results
    *   Incorrect Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: Underfilling or overfilling the collection tube can alter the test results
    *   Delayed Testing: Platelet function can change over time, so the test should be performed within the specified timeframe (usually 2-4 hours of collection)
    *   Storage Temperature: Improper storage temperatures can affect platelet function
    
*   **Analytical Variables:**

    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the PFA instrument
    *   Reagent Problems: Use fresh, properly stored cartridges
    *   Hematocrit: Hematocrit values outside the specified range can affect the closure time
        *   Low Hematocrit: Can prolong the closure time
        *   High Hematocrit: Can shorten the closure time
    *   Platelet Count: Platelet counts outside the specified range can affect the closure time
    
*   **Patient-Related Variables:**

    *   Medications:
        *   Aspirin and NSAIDs: Inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and impair thromboxane A2 production, leading to prolonged Epi-CT
        *   P2Y12 Inhibitors: Clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor block the ADP receptor on platelets, leading to prolonged ADP-CT and Epi-CT
    *   Underlying Medical Conditions:
        *   von Willebrand Disease (vWD): Deficiency or dysfunction of vWF can impair platelet adhesion and prolong closure times
        *   Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count can affect closure times

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the PFA results are unexpected or inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation:

    *   Check the sample for clots or hemolysis
    *   Verify that the hematocrit and platelet count are within the acceptable range for the instrument
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Review the patient's medication list and medical history
    *   Consider performing platelet aggregation studies or other specialized tests

## **Reflex Testing** {-}

*   If the PFA results are abnormal, additional testing may be performed to:

    *   Investigate potential underlying causes of platelet dysfunction
        *   Platelet Aggregation Studies: To assess platelet aggregation in response to various agonists (ADP, collagen, epinephrine, thrombin, arachidonic acid, ristocetin)
        *   Flow Cytometry: To measure platelet surface markers and assess platelet activation
        *   Bleeding Time: Seldom performed now a days

# Hereditary {-}

## **Overview of Hereditary Coagulation Factor Deficiencies** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of rare, inherited bleeding disorders caused by genetic mutations that result in a deficiency or dysfunction of one or more coagulation factors
*   **Inheritance:** Typically inherited in an X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive pattern
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Bleeding Tendency: The primary symptom, with severity varying depending on the specific factor involved and the degree of deficiency
    *   Common Manifestations:
        *   Easy bruising
        *   Prolonged bleeding after cuts, dental procedures, or surgery
        *   Nosebleeds (epistaxis)
        *   Gum bleeding
        *   Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) in women
        *   Hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints)
        *   Intracranial hemorrhage (rare but life-threatening)
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Based on clinical history, bleeding symptoms, family history, and laboratory testing (coagulation assays)
    *   Specific diagnosis requires factor assays to measure the activity of individual coagulation factors

## **Specific Hereditary Coagulation Factor Deficiencies** {-}

*   **X-Linked Recessive Disorders**

    *   **Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency):**
        *   **Definition:** The most common inherited bleeding disorder; caused by mutations in the *F8* gene, which encodes Factor VIII (FVIII)
        *   **Pathophysiology:** Deficiency of FVIII impairs the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, leading to decreased thrombin generation and impaired clot formation
        *   **Severity:** Classified based on the level of FVIII activity:
            *   Severe Hemophilia A: FVIII < 1% of normal
            *   Moderate Hemophilia A: FVIII 1-5% of normal
            *   Mild Hemophilia A: FVIII 5-40% of normal
        *   **Clinical Features:**
            *   Severity of bleeding is correlated with the level of FVIII activity
            *   Severe Hemophilia:
                *   Spontaneous bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis) and muscles
                *   Prolonged bleeding after minor trauma or surgery
                *   Intracranial hemorrhage
            *   Moderate and Mild Hemophilia:
                *   Bleeding typically occurs after trauma or surgery
                *   Spontaneous bleeding is less common
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**
            *   CBC: Normal platelet count
            *   Prothrombin Time (PT): Normal
            *   Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): Prolonged
            *   Mixing Study: aPTT corrects with mixing with normal plasma
            *   Factor VIII Assay: Decreased FVIII activity level
            *   Factor Inhibitor Assay: To rule out acquired FVIII inhibitors
        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Replacement Therapy: Infusion of FVIII concentrates
                *   Recombinant FVIII products are preferred to minimize the risk of viral transmission
                *   Prophylactic therapy: Regular infusions of FVIII to prevent bleeding
                *   On-demand therapy: FVIII infusions to treat acute bleeding episodes
            *   Desmopressin (DDAVP):
                *   May be effective in mild hemophilia A to stimulate the release of FVIII from endothelial cells
            *   Emicizumab:
                *   A bispecific antibody that mimics the cofactor function of FVIII, bridging Factors IXa and X to restore coagulation
                *   Used for prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors
            *   Gene Therapy:
                *   Emerging therapeutic approach to correct the *F8* gene mutation and restore FVIII production
    
    *   **Hemophilia B (Factor IX Deficiency, Christmas Disease):**
        *   **Definition:** A less common X-linked recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the *F9* gene, which encodes Factor IX (FIX)
        *   **Pathophysiology:** Deficiency of FIX impairs the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, leading to decreased thrombin generation and impaired clot formation
        *   **Clinical Features and Laboratory Findings:** Similar to hemophilia A, but FVIII levels are normal and FIX levels are decreased.
        *   **Treatment:**
            *   Replacement Therapy: Infusion of FIX concentrates
            *   Gene Therapy: Emerging therapeutic approach to correct the *F9* gene mutation and restore FIX production

    *   For Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B, there are now options for gene therapy to be curative for the disease.
    *   This treatment is an option if there are high factor levels
    *   This test is used after to monitor production of factor.

## **Overview of Qualitative Platelet Disorders** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of disorders characterized by abnormal platelet function, despite a normal (or near normal) platelet count. In these disorders, platelets are present in adequate numbers, but they do not function correctly, leading to a bleeding tendency
*   **Types:**
    *   Inherited (Congenital): Genetic defects in platelet membrane glycoproteins, receptors, or signaling pathways
    *   Acquired: Due to medications, systemic diseases, or other factors that impair platelet function
*   **Common Manifestations:**
    *   Mucocutaneous bleeding: Bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes (e.g., nosebleeds, gum bleeding, easy bruising, menorrhagia)
    *   Prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery

## **Inherited Qualitative Platelet Disorders** {-}

*   **von Willebrand Disease (vWD):**
    *   **Definition:** The most common inherited bleeding disorder, caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF)

*   **Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS):**
    *   **Definition:** A rare inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX/V (GPIb/IX/V) complex

*   **Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT):**
    *   **Definition:** A rare inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complex (also known as αIIbβ3 integrin)

## **Acquired Qualitative Platelet Disorders** {-}

*   **Drug-Induced Platelet Dysfunction:**
    *   Aspirin: Irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1), preventing the production of thromboxane A2 (TxA2), a potent platelet activator
    *   NSAIDs: Reversibly inhibit COX-1 and COX-2
    *   Clopidogrel and Prasugrel: Block the ADP receptor (P2Y12) on platelets, inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation
    *   Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban: Block the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, preventing platelet aggregation
*   **Uremia (Chronic Kidney Disease):**
    *   Uremic toxins accumulate in the plasma and impair platelet function
    *   Correcting the uremia with dialysis can improve platelet function
*   **Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs):**
    *   Platelets may have abnormal function despite being elevated in number

## **General Laboratory Tests for Qualitative Platelet Disorders** {-}

*   **Platelet Count:** To rule out thrombocytopenia
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:** To assess platelet morphology (e.g., size, granulation)
*   **Bleeding Time:** Historically used to assess platelet function, but now largely replaced by more specific tests
*   **Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100):** Measures platelet function under high shear stress
*   **Platelet Aggregation Studies:** Measure platelet aggregation in response to various agonists (ADP, collagen, epinephrine, thrombin, ristocetin)
*   **Flow Cytometry:** To assess the expression of platelet membrane glycoproteins and receptors
*   **Specialized Assays:**
    *   vWF Antigen (vWF:Ag)
    *   vWF Activity (vWF:RCo)
    *   Factor VIII Level (FVIII:C)
    *   ADAMTS13 Activity Assay

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Qualitative Platelet Disorder:** A disorder in which platelets are present in adequate numbers but do not function correctly
*   **Von Willebrand Factor (vWF):** A protein that mediates platelet adhesion and carries factor VIII
*   **GPIb/IX/V:** Platelet glycoprotein receptor for vWF
*   **GPIIb/IIIa:** Platelet glycoprotein receptor for fibrinogen
*   **Platelet Aggregation:** The clumping together of platelets
*   **Ristocetin:** An antibiotic that induces vWF-dependent platelet agglutination
*   **PFA-100:** A test that measures platelet function under high shear stress
*   **Thrombopoietin (TPO):** A hormone that stimulates megakaryocyte and platelet production

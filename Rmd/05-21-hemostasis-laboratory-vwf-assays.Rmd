# von Willebrand Assays {-}

## **Overview of von Willebrand Assays** {-}

*   **Definition:** A panel of laboratory tests used to assess the quantity and function of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein essential for normal blood clotting
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Diagnosis of von Willebrand Disease (vWD): Confirms the diagnosis and helps classify the type of vWD
    *   Differentiation of vWD from other Bleeding Disorders: Helps distinguish vWD from hemophilia and other platelet function disorders
    *   Evaluation of Unexplained Bleeding: Used to investigate patients with a personal or family history of mucocutaneous bleeding
    *   Monitoring Treatment: Used to monitor the response to treatment for vWD (e.g., desmopressin, vWF concentrates)
*   **Key Assays:**
    *   vWF Antigen (vWF:Ag)
    *   vWF Activity (vWF:RCo)
    *   Factor VIII Activity (FVIII:C)
    *   vWF Multimeric Analysis
    *   Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100) - though not specific to vWF, it can assist in diagnosis

## **Components of von Willebrand Assays** {-}

*   **Specimen Collection:**
    *   Collection Tube: Sodium citrate (light blue top) tube with a 3.2% or 3.8% sodium citrate concentration
    *   Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: The correct ratio is critical for accurate coagulation testing:
        *   9:1 ratio of blood to anticoagulant
    *   Processing:
        *   Centrifuge the sodium citrate tube to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
        *   PPP should have a platelet count < 10 x 10^9/L
        *   Test should be performed within 4 hours of collection or the plasma should be frozen if testing will be performed later. Specifics will vary from lab to lab
*   **Reagents:**
    *   vWF:Ag Reagent: Contains antibodies specific for vWF
    *   vWF:RCo Reagent: Contains ristocetin, a substance that induces vWF-dependent platelet agglutination
    *   Factor VIII Reagent: Contains purified factor VIII

## **Individual Assays** {-}

*   **von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF:Ag):**

    *   *Principle:* Measures the amount of vWF protein in the plasma, regardless of its function
    *   *Methods:*
        *   Immunoturbidimetry: Measures the turbidity caused by the formation of antigen-antibody complexes
        *   Nephelometry: Measures the light scattered by the antigen-antibody complexes
        *   ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay): Uses enzyme-labeled antibodies to detect vWF
    *   *Procedure:*
        1.  Add anti-vWF antibodies
        2.  Read for what test is used whether it is measuring the antibody or test light to determine the concentration with the reference range

    *   *Reporting:*
        *   Reported as a percentage of normal or in IU/dL
        *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the laboratory and the assay used (e.g., 50-200%)

    *   *Interpretation:*
        *   Decreased vWF:Ag: Suggests a quantitative deficiency of vWF (seen in type 1 and type 3 vWD)
        *   Normal vWF:Ag: Does not rule out vWD; may be seen in qualitative vWF defects (type 2 vWD)

*   **von Willebrand Factor Activity (vWF:RCo):**

    *   *Principle:* Measures the ability of vWF to bind to platelets in the presence of ristocetin, a cofactor that promotes vWF-dependent platelet agglutination
    *   *Method:*
        *   Ristocetin-Induced Platelet Agglutination (RIPA):
            *   Measures the rate of platelet agglutination after the addition of ristocetin and vWF-containing plasma
            *   The degree of agglutination is proportional to the vWF activity
        *   Automated vWF Activity Assays:
            *   Use modified latex particles coated with GPIbÎ± (the vWF receptor on platelets)
            *   Measure the binding of vWF to the latex particles in the presence of ristocetin
            *   Automated latex agglutination test can also be called vWF:Glycoprotein 1b Binding Assay (vWF:GPIbM)
    *   *Procedure:*
        1.  Test is ran through an analyzer
        2.  The agglutination is read
    *   *Reporting:*
        *   Reported as a percentage of normal or in IU/dL
        *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the laboratory and the assay used (e.g., 50-200%)
    *   *Interpretation:*
        *   Decreased vWF:RCo: Suggests a functional defect in vWF (seen in most types of vWD)
        *   Increased vWF:RCo: Seen in type 2B vWD (vWF has increased affinity for platelets)

*   **Factor VIII Activity (FVIII:C):**

    *   *Principle:* Measures the activity of factor VIII, a coagulation protein that is bound to and stabilized by vWF
    *   *Methods:*
        *   Chromogenic Assay: Measures the amount of activated Factor X (Factor Xa) produced in the presence of Factor VIII and other coagulation factors
        *   Clotting Assay: Measures the ability of plasma to correct the aPTT of Factor VIII-deficient plasma
    *   *Procedure:*
        *   Follow [Factor Assay][Factor Assays] procedure

    *   *Reporting:*
        *   Reported as a percentage of normal or in IU/dL
        *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the laboratory and the assay used (e.g., 50-150%)
    *   *Interpretation:*
        *   Decreased FVIII:C: Suggests vWD type 2N (decreased binding of vWF to FVIII) or hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency)

*   **vWF Multimeric Analysis:**

    *   *Principle:* Evaluates the distribution of vWF multimers, which are polymers of vWF subunits
    *   *Method:*
        *   Gel Electrophoresis: vWF multimers are separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel
        *   Immunoblotting: The separated multimers are transferred to a membrane and detected with an antibody specific for vWF
        *   Visualization: The multimers are visualized using a staining or detection method
    *   *Interpretation:*
        *   Normal Multimer Pattern: A full range of vWF multimers is present
        *   Abnormal Multimer Pattern: Decreased high-molecular-weight multimers (HMW multimers) are seen in type 2A vWD
    *   *Clinical Significance:* Helps differentiate type 2A vWD from other subtypes of vWD

## **PFA-100 (Platelet Function Analyzer)** {-}

*   **Principle:** Measures platelet function under high shear stress by aspirating blood through a small aperture coated with collagen and epinephrine or collagen and ADP
*   **Procedure:**
    *   A citrated whole blood sample is aspirated through a small aperture coated with collagen and either epinephrine or ADP
    *   The time it takes for the aperture to become occluded by a platelet plug is measured (closure time)
*   **Results:**
    *   Closure Time (CT):
        *   Epinephrine Closure Time (Epi-CT): Measures platelet function in response to collagen and epinephrine
        *   ADP Closure Time (ADP-CT): Measures platelet function in response to collagen and ADP
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Prolonged Closure Time: Suggests platelet dysfunction
        *   Prolonged Epi-CT and ADP-CT: May be seen in vWD, aspirin use, or other platelet function disorders
    *   Normal Closure Time: Does not rule out vWD or other platelet function disorders
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Affected by Hematocrit: Must be performed on samples with a hematocrit within the specified range
    *   Affected by Platelet count: Must be performed on samples with a platelet count within the specified range
    *   Not Specific for vWD: Prolonged closure time can be seen in other platelet function disorders

## **Factors Affecting von Willebrand Assay Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**

    *   Improper Collection Technique: Tissue thromboplastin contamination or hemolysis
    *   Incorrect Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: Underfilling or overfilling the collection tube
    *   Clotted Sample: Invalidates the results
    *   Delayed Testing: vWF and FVIII can degrade over time
    *   Improper Storage: Incorrect storage temperatures can affect results
*   **Analytical Variables:**

    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the coagulation analyzer
    *   Reagent Problems: Use fresh, properly stored reagents and follow the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Interfering Substances: Lipemia or icterus can interfere with optical clot detection
    *   Assay Sensitivity: Different assays have different sensitivities for detecting vWF abnormalities
*   **Patient-Related Variables:**

    *   Blood Type: vWF levels are typically lower in individuals with blood type O
    *   Age: vWF levels increase with age
    *   Pregnancy: vWF levels increase during pregnancy
    *   Estrogen Therapy: Increases vWF levels
    *   Acute Phase Reactants: vWF is an acute phase reactant, so levels can increase during inflammation or infection

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the vWF assay results are unexpected or inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation:

    *   Check the sample for clots or hemolysis
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Ensure that the correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio was used
    *   Verify the instrument and reagent quality control results
    *   Consider repeating the vWF assays after a period of stability (to account for normal fluctuations in vWF levels)
    *   Evaluate for potential interfering substances or medications
    *   Consult with a pathologist or coagulation expert

## **Reflex Testing** {-}

*   If the initial vWF assays are abnormal, further testing may be performed to:

    *   Characterize the type of vWD (e.g., multimer analysis, FVIII binding assay)
    *   Rule out other causes of bleeding (e.g., platelet function disorders)
    *   Perform genetic testing to identify specific vWF gene mutations

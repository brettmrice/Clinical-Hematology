# Normocytic {-}

## **Normocytic Anemias** {-}

*   **Characteristics:** Normal-sized RBCs (MCV 80-100 fL)
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   Evaluate reticulocyte count to determine if the bone marrow is responding appropriately to the anemia
        *   **High Reticulocyte Count:** Suggests increased RBC destruction (hemolysis) or acute blood loss
        *   **Low Reticulocyte Count:** Suggests decreased RBC production due to bone marrow disorders, chronic diseases, or early nutritional deficiencies
*   **Common Causes:**
    *   **Acute Blood Loss:**
        *   Sudden loss of blood due to trauma, surgery, or gastrointestinal bleeding
        *   Initial CBC may be normocytic and normochromic, but iron deficiency can develop over time
    *   **Hemolytic Anemias:**
        *   Increased destruction of RBCs due to inherited or acquired causes
        *   Peripheral blood smear: May show spherocytes, schistocytes, or other abnormal RBC morphologies
        *   Lab findings:
            *   Elevated reticulocyte count
            *   Elevated indirect bilirubin
            *   Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
            *   Decreased haptoglobin
            *   Positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) in autoimmune hemolytic anemia
        *   **Inherited Hemolytic Anemias:**
            *   Hereditary spherocytosis: Membrane defect leading to spherical RBCs
            *   Sickle cell anemia: Abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) leading to sickling of RBCs
            *   Thalassemia: (Can also cause microcytic anemia.)
            *   G6PD deficiency: Enzyme deficiency leading to oxidative damage
        *   **Acquired Hemolytic Anemias:**
            *   Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Antibodies against RBCs
            *   Drug-induced hemolytic anemia: Caused by certain medications
            *   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA): Mechanical destruction of RBCs in small blood vessels (e.g., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC))
    *   **Anemia of Chronic Disease/Inflammation:**
        *   (Can also cause microcytic anemia.)
    *   **Aplastic Anemia:**
        *   Bone marrow failure resulting in decreased production of all blood cell lines (pancytopenia)
        *   Causes: Autoimmune, drug-induced, infections, or inherited
        *   Bone marrow examination: Hypocellular marrow
    *   **Chronic Kidney Disease:**
        *   Decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO)
        *   Peripheral blood smear: Normocytic, normochromic RBCs

## **Laboratory Tests for Anemia** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Hemoglobin (HGB)
    *   Hematocrit (HCT)
    *   Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)
    *   Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)
    *   White Blood Cell Count (WBC) and Differential
    *   Platelet Count
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
    *   RBC morphology (size, shape, color)
    *   WBC differential
    *   Platelet estimate
*   **Reticulocyte Count:**
    *   Percentage and absolute number of reticulocytes
    *   Corrected Reticulocyte Count/Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI)
*   **Iron Studies:**
    *   Serum Iron
    *   Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC)
    *   Transferrin Saturation
    *   Ferritin
*   **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:**
    *   Serum B12
    *   Red Blood Cell Folate
*   **Methylmalonic Acid (MMA) and Homocysteine Levels:**
    *   Elevated in B12 Deficiency
    *   Homocysteine also Elevated in Folate Deficiency
*   **Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:**
    *   Identifies abnormal hemoglobin variants (e.g., HbS, HbC)
*   **Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT):**
    *   Detects antibodies or complement proteins on the surface of RBCs
*   **Bone Marrow Examination:**
    *   Cellularity
    *   Maturation of cell lines
    *   Presence of abnormal cells
*   **Other Tests:**
    *   Haptoglobin and LDH (for hemolysis)
    *   Coombs test (for autoimmune hemolytic anemia)
    *   Osmotic Fragility Test (for hereditary spherocytosis)
    *   G6PD Assay (for G6PD deficiency)

# Fibrinogen {-}

## **Overview of Fibrinogen Assay** {-}

*   **Definition:** A quantitative assay that measures the concentration of fibrinogen (Factor I) in plasma. Fibrinogen is a key protein in the coagulation cascade, essential for forming the fibrin clot
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Diagnosis of Bleeding Disorders: Low fibrinogen levels can contribute to bleeding tendencies
    *   Evaluation of Liver Function: Fibrinogen is synthesized in the liver, so levels can be decreased in liver disease
    *   Assessment of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Fibrinogen levels are often decreased in DIC due to consumption
    *   Diagnosis of Inherited Fibrinogen Disorders: Afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and dysfibrinogenemia
    *   Assessment of Thrombotic Risk: Fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant, and elevated levels may be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis
*   **Methods:**
    *   Clauss Method (Functional Assay)
    *   Immunologic Methods

## **Clauss Method (Functional Assay)** {-}

*   **Principle:** The Clauss method is a functional assay that measures the rate of clot formation after the addition of a high concentration of thrombin to diluted plasma. The clotting time is inversely proportional to the fibrinogen concentration
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Plasma Dilution: The patient's plasma is diluted with a buffer to a specific concentration
    2.  Thrombin Addition: A high concentration of thrombin is added to the diluted plasma
    3.  Clot Detection: The time to clot formation is measured, either manually or using an automated coagulation analyzer
    4.  Calculation: The fibrinogen concentration is determined by comparing the clotting time to a calibration curve generated using fibrinogen standards of known concentrations
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Measures the functional activity of fibrinogen, which is important for assessing the patient's ability to form a stable clot
    *   Relatively simple and widely available
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Can be affected by inhibitors of thrombin (e.g., heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors)
    *   May be inaccurate in patients with dysfibrinogenemia (abnormal fibrinogen molecule)

## **Immunologic Methods** {-}

*   **Principle:** These methods measure the amount of fibrinogen protein, regardless of its function
*   **Methods:**
    *   Nephelometry: Measures the turbidity caused by the formation of antigen-antibody complexes
    *   Turbidimetry: Measures the decrease in light transmission through a solution as antigen-antibody complexes form
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Add a specific antibody that targets fibrinogen to the sample
    2.  Antigen-Antibody Complexes forms turbidity
    3.  Measures the amount of the turbidity to determine how much fibrinogen is in the sample
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Not affected by inhibitors of thrombin
    *   May be more accurate in patients with dysfibrinogenemia
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Does not assess the functional activity of fibrinogen
    *   Can be affected by interfering substances (e.g., lipemia, high protein levels)

## **Specimen Collection and Handling** {-}

*   **Collection Tube:** Sodium citrate (light blue top) tube with a 3.2% or 3.8% sodium citrate concentration
*   **Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio:** The correct ratio is critical for accurate coagulation testing:
    *   9:1 ratio of blood to anticoagulant
    *   Underfilling the tube can lead to falsely prolonged clotting times due to excess anticoagulant
    *   Overfilling the tube can lead to falsely shortened clotting times due to insufficient anticoagulant
*   **Processing:**
    *   Centrifuge the sodium citrate tube to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
    *   PPP should have a platelet count < 10 x 10^9/L
    *   Test should be performed within 4 hours of collection or the plasma should be frozen to maintain optimal value of fibrongien

## **Factors Affecting Fibrinogen Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**
    *   Improper Collection Technique: Tissue thromboplastin contamination or hemolysis
    *   Incorrect Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: Underfilling or overfilling the collection tube
    *   Clotted Sample: Invalidates the results
    *   Delayed Testing: Fibrinogen can degrade over time
    *   Improper Storage: Incorrect storage temperatures can affect results
*   **Analytical Variables:**
    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the coagulation analyzer
    *   Reagent Problems: Use fresh, properly stored reagents and follow the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Lipemia or Icterus: Can interfere with optical clot detection or turbidimetric measurements
*   **Patient-Related Variables:**
    *   Medications: Fibrinolytic agents (e.g., tPA, streptokinase) can decrease fibrinogen levels
    *   Liver Disease: Impairs the synthesis of fibrinogen
    *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Consumption of fibrinogen

## **Interpreting Results** {-}

*   **Reference Range:** Varies depending on the method and laboratory; a typical range is 200-400 mg/dL
*   **Elevated Fibrinogen:**
    *   Acute Phase Reaction: Fibrinogen is an acute-phase reactant, so levels can increase during inflammation, infection, trauma, or surgery
    *   Pregnancy: Fibrinogen levels increase during pregnancy
    *   Oral Contraceptive Use
    *   Increased Risk of Thrombosis
*   **Decreased Fibrinogen:**
    *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Consumption of fibrinogen
    *   Liver Disease: Impaired fibrinogen synthesis
    *   Inherited Fibrinogen Disorders:
        *   Afibrinogenemia: Complete absence of fibrinogen (rare)
        *   Hypofibrinogenemia: Reduced levels of fibrinogen
        *   Dysfibrinogenemia: Presence of a dysfunctional fibrinogen molecule that does not clot properly
        *   Amylodosis

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the fibrinogen result is inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation or previous results:
    *   Check the sample for clots or hemolysis
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Ensure that the correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio was used
    *   Verify the instrument and reagent quality control results
    *   Investigate potential interfering substances (e.g., lipemia)
    *   Review the patient's medication list and medical history

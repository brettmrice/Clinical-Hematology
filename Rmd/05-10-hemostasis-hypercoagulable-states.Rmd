## **Overview of Hypercoagulable States (Thrombophilia)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of inherited or acquired conditions that increase the risk of developing thrombosis (blood clots)
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Alterations in the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors in the blood
    *   Increased thrombin generation and decreased fibrinolysis
*   **Classification:**
    *   Inherited (Genetic) Thrombophilias: Caused by genetic mutations affecting coagulation factors or natural anticoagulants
    *   Acquired Thrombophilias: Caused by external factors that alter the coagulation system
*   **Clinical Significance:** Increased risk of venous and/or arterial thrombosis
    *   Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
    *   Pulmonary embolism (PE)
    *   Stroke
    *   Myocardial infarction
    *   Recurrent pregnancy loss

## **Virchow's Triad** {-}

Virchow's triad describes the three broad categories of factors that contribute to thrombosis:

*   **Hypercoagulability:** Increased tendency to clot due to inherited or acquired abnormalities in the coagulation system
*   **Hemodynamic Changes (Stasis or Turbulence):** Altered blood flow, such as occurs with prolonged immobility or atrial fibrillation
*   **Endothelial Injury:** Damage to the blood vessel wall, exposing subendothelial collagen and tissue factor

## **Inherited Thrombophilias (Genetic)** {-}

*   **Factor V Leiden Mutation:**
    *   **Definition:** The most common inherited thrombophilia; caused by a point mutation in the *F5* gene, which encodes Factor V
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   Mutation: A single nucleotide change (G to A) at position 1691 in the *F5* gene, resulting in a glutamine (Q) to arginine (R) substitution at position 506 (FV R506Q)
        *   Resistance to Activated Protein C (APC): The Factor V Leiden mutation makes Factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C (APC), a natural anticoagulant
        *   Increased Thrombin Generation: Prolonged activity of Factor V leads to increased thrombin generation and a prothrombotic state
    *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant
        *   Heterozygous: One copy of the mutated gene (increased risk of thrombosis)
        *   Homozygous: Two copies of the mutated gene (higher risk of thrombosis)
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Increased risk of venous thrombosis (DVT, PE)
        *   Increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss
        *   The risk of thrombosis is higher in individuals with Factor V Leiden who also have other risk factors (e.g., oral contraceptives, pregnancy, surgery)
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   Activated Protein C (APC) Resistance Assay:
            *   Prolonged aPTT with normal plasma
            *   aPTT does not prolong with APC
        *   Factor V Leiden Mutation Analysis:
            *   Confirms the presence of the Factor V Leiden mutation (DNA testing)
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Anticoagulation:
            *   Warfarin (Coumadin)
            *   Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): Rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran
        *   Prophylactic Anticoagulation:
            *   May be considered in high-risk situations (e.g., surgery, pregnancy)

*   **Prothrombin G20210A Mutation:**
    *   **Definition:** The second most common inherited thrombophilia; caused by a point mutation in the *F2* gene, which encodes prothrombin (Factor II)
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   Mutation: A single nucleotide change (G to A) at position 20210 in the 3'-untranslated region of the *F2* gene
        *   Increased Prothrombin Levels: Leads to increased prothrombin mRNA stability and increased prothrombin production
        *   Increased Thrombin Generation: Elevated prothrombin levels result in increased thrombin generation and a prothrombotic state
    *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant
        *   Heterozygous: One copy of the mutated gene
        *   Homozygous: Two copies of the mutated gene
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Increased risk of venous thrombosis (DVT, PE)
        *   Increased risk of arterial thrombosis (stroke, myocardial infarction)
        *   Increased risk of recurrent pregnancy loss
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   Prothrombin G20210A Mutation Analysis:
            *   Confirms the presence of the prothrombin G20210A mutation (DNA testing)
        *   Prothrombin Level: May be elevated
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Anticoagulation:
            *   Warfarin (Coumadin)
            *   Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): Rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran

            *   May be considered in high-risk situations (e.g., surgery, pregnancy)

*   **Protein C Deficiency:**
    *   **Definition:** Inherited deficiency of protein C, a natural anticoagulant
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   Protein C: A vitamin K-dependent serine protease that is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex
        *   Activated Protein C (APC): Degrades Factors Va and VIIIa, inhibiting thrombin generation
        *   Protein C Deficiency: Reduces the ability to inactivate Factors Va and VIIIa, leading to a prothrombotic state
    *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive (more severe)
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Venous thrombosis (DVT, PE)
        *   Warfarin-induced skin necrosis: A rare but serious complication that can occur when starting warfarin therapy in patients with severe protein C deficiency

*   **Protein S Deficiency:**
    *   **Definition:** Inherited deficiency of protein S, a cofactor for activated protein C (APC)
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   Protein S: A vitamin K-dependent protein that acts as a cofactor for APC in the inactivation of Factors Va and VIIIa
        *   Protein S Deficiency: Reduces the ability of APC to inhibit thrombin generation, leading to a prothrombotic state
    *   **Inheritance:** Autosomal dominant
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Venous thrombosis (DVT, PE)
        *   Arterial thrombosis (less common)

                *   Start with caution due to the risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis
                *   Overlap with a parenteral anticoagulant (e.g., heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin) is recommended when starting warfarin
            *   Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): Rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran

        *   Antithrombin Deficiency: Reduces the ability to inhibit thrombin and other coagulation factors, leading to a prothrombotic state

        *   Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Testing: May be necessary to rule out HIT, as heparin resistance is a common feature
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Anticoagulation:
            *   Warfarin (Coumadin): Higher doses of warfarin may be required to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation
            *   Direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., argatroban, bivalirudin): May be used in patients with heparin resistance or HIT

            *   Phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays (e.g., dRVVT, SCT) are prolonged and do not correct with the addition of phospholipid
        *   Anticardiolipin Antibodies (aCL):
            *   Increased levels of IgG and/or IgM aCL antibodies
        *   Anti-β2 Glycoprotein I Antibodies (anti-β2GPI):
            *   Increased levels of IgG and/or IgM anti-β2GPI antibodies
        *   Persistent Positivity: aPL must be present on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, to meet the laboratory criteria for APS
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Anticoagulation:
            *   Warfarin (Coumadin) is the traditional anticoagulant

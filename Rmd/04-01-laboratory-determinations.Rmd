## **Overview of Cell Counts** {-}

*   **Definition:** A fundamental laboratory test used to enumerate the cellular components of blood and body fluids
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Diagnosis and monitoring of a wide range of medical conditions, including:
        *   Infections
        *   Inflammatory disorders
        *   Hematologic malignancies
        *   Bone marrow disorders
        *   Bleeding disorders
*   **Types of Cell Counts:**
    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC): Measures the number of RBCs, WBCs, and PLTs in whole blood
    *   Body Fluid Cell Counts: Measures the number of RBCs and TNCs (total nucleated cells) in various body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, serous fluids)
    *   Reticulocyte Count: Measures the number of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in whole blood
*   **Methods:**
    *   Manual Cell Counts: Performed using a microscope and a specialized counting chamber
    *   Automated Cell Counts: Performed using automated hematology analyzers

## **Manual Cell Counts** {-}
*   **Principle:**
    *   A known volume of diluted fluid is placed in a specialized counting chamber (hemocytometer)
    *   The cells are counted within a defined area of the counting chamber under a microscope
    *   The cell count per unit volume is calculated using a formula that takes into account the dilution factor and the area of the counting chamber

## **Automated Cell Counts** {-}
*   **Principle:**
    *   Automated hematology analyzers use various technologies to count and characterize blood cells
    *   Common technologies include:
        *   Electrical Impedance (Coulter Principle): Cells pass through a small aperture, disrupting an electrical current; the number and size of the disruptions are measured
        *   Optical Scatter: Cells pass through a light beam, and the amount and angle of light scattered are measured; provides information about cell size, shape, and granularity
        *   Flow Cytometry: Cells are stained with fluorescent dyes and passed through a laser beam; the fluorescence intensity and scatter patterns are measured

## **Reticulocyte Counts** {-}
*   **Principle:** Measurement of the number of immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in the peripheral blood

## **Quality Control (QC) and Troubleshooting** {-}
*   **Manual Cell Counts:**
    *   Use calibrated pipettes and equipment
    *   Maintain clean equipment
    *   Use proper staining techniques
    *   Count an adequate number of cells
    *   Follow established procedures
    *   Perform duplicate counts to assess precision
*   **Automated Cell Counts:**
    *   Perform daily instrument calibration and maintenance
    *   Run control materials at regular intervals
    *   Review control results and take corrective action if necessary
    *   Investigate flags and alarms generated by the instrument
    *   Correlate automated results with peripheral blood smear findings
*   **General Troubleshooting:**
    *   Identify and correct pre-analytical errors (e.g., clotted sample, improper collection)
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Perform manual cell counts to confirm automated results
    *   Consult with a supervisor or pathologist if the cause of the discrepancy cannot be determined

## **Reporting Results** {-}
*   Report the cell counts in the appropriate units (e.g., cells/Î¼L, x 10^9/L)
*   Include the reference range for each parameter
*   Note any abnormal results or flags
*   Document all quality control procedures and corrective actions taken

## **Key Terms** {-}
*   **Cell Count:** Enumeration of cells in a fluid sample
*   **Hemocytometer:** A specialized counting chamber used for manual cell counts
*   **Dilution Factor:** The ratio of the final volume to the initial sample volume
*   **Reticulocyte:** Immature red blood cell
*   **Supravital Stain:** A dye used to stain living cells
*   **Electrical Impedance (Coulter Principle):** A method for counting and sizing cells
*   **Optical Scatter:** A method for characterizing cells based on light scattering properties
*   **Flow Cytometry:** A technique for identifying and quantifying cells based on their surface markers and other characteristics

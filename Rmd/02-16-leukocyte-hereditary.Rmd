# Hereditary {-}

This category encompasses several rare, inherited disorders that affect the morphology and/or function of leukocytes, and have been listed in the WHO classification

##  **Hereditary Anomalies of Leukocytes** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of inherited disorders characterized by distinct morphological or functional abnormalities in leukocytes
*   **Key Features**
    *   Present from Birth: These abnormalities are present from birth and persist throughout life
    *   Typically Benign: Most are asymptomatic and do not cause significant clinical problems
    *   Recognizable Morphology: They are recognized by their distinctive morphological features on the peripheral blood smear
    *   Genetic Basis: Caused by mutations in specific genes
*   **Importance of Recognition:** Crucial for laboratory personnel to recognize these anomalies to avoid misdiagnosis of more serious conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute leukemia

##  **Specific Hereditary Anomalies** {-}

Here's a breakdown of the key hereditary anomalies, including their genetic basis, morphological features, clinical significance, and laboratory findings:

### **Pelger-Huët Anomaly (PHA)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A benign inherited disorder characterized by a high percentage of neutrophils with bilobed or unsegmented nuclei (hyposegmentation)
*   **Genetic Basis:**
    *   Autosomal dominant inheritance
    *   Most commonly caused by a mutation in the *Lamin B Receptor (LBR)* gene on chromosome 1q42.13
*   **Pathophysiology:** Mutation in *LBR* gene disrupts normal neutrophil nuclear segmentation. Remember that this is one of the later steps in maturation!
*   **Morphological Features**
    *   Increased number of neutrophils with bilobed or unsegmented nuclei
    *   Nuclei have a "pince-nez" or "dumbbell" shape
    *   Normal chromatin condensation
    *   Cells otherwise appear normal, and typically don't have other qualitative features
    *   May see occasional unsegmented neutrophils (band forms)
    *   All neutrophils are affected (uniformity of findings)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Benign and Asymptomatic: Does not cause any health problems
    *   Importance of Recognition: Must be distinguished from *pseudo*-Pelger-Huët anomaly, which is associated with more serious conditions like MDS
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   CBC: Normal WBC count
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Increased percentage of neutrophils with bilobed or unsegmented nuclei
        *   Normal neutrophils with 3-4 lobes may be present, but are less common than bilobed cells
        *   Lack of toxic granulation or other dysplastic features
    *   Reticulocyte Count
    *   Family Testing: Not required for diagnosis but may be done to confirm hereditary nature of the abnormality

*   **How to Distinguish From Pseudo-Pelger-Huët Anomaly:** A "true" PHA usually occurs in all cell lines, is always present, and exhibits cells that are still properly shaped

### **May-Hegglin Anomaly (MHA)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by:
    *   Large, pale-blue inclusions (Döhle bodies) in neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes
    *   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
    *   Giant Platelets (megathrombocytes)
*   **Genetic Basis:** Caused by mutations in the *MYH9* gene, which encodes nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA
*   **Pathophysiology**
    *   Abnormal Myosin Heavy Chain: Affects normal platelet and leukocyte function
    *   Döhle Bodies: Consist of aggregates of abnormal myosin heavy chain
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Results from impaired platelet production and increased platelet destruction
*   **Morphological Features**
    *   Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, and Monocytes: Contain large, pale-blue, spindle-shaped or round inclusions (Döhle bodies)
    *   Platelets: Thrombocytopenia with giant platelets
    *   Easy to see on PBS at 40X lens strength
*   **Clinical Features**
    *   Mild to moderate bleeding tendencies:
        *   Easy bruising
        *   Nosebleeds
        *   Prolonged bleeding after cuts or surgery
    *   Most patients are asymptomatic
*   **Laboratory Findings**
    *   CBC:
        *   Thrombocytopenia (platelet count often between 50-100 x 10^9/L)
        *   Normal WBC count
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Döhle-like inclusions in neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes
        *   Giant platelets (macrothrombocytes)
*   **Treatment**
    *   Usually supportive
    *   Avoid aspirin and other antiplatelet agents
    *   Platelet transfusions may be necessary for severe bleeding
    *   Desmopressin may be helpful in some cases
    *   Genetic counseling

### **Alder-Reilly Anomaly** {-}

*   **Definition:** A rare, inherited anomaly characterized by large, intensely staining granules in all types of leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils)
*   **Genetic Basis**
    *   Autosomal recessive inheritance
    *   Caused by a deficiency in certain lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradation of mucopolysaccharides
*   **Pathophysiology**
    *   Lysosomal Storage Disorder: Deficiency of lysosomal enzymes leads to the accumulation of undigested mucopolysaccharides in lysosomes
    *   Granule Formation: The accumulated mucopolysaccharides form large granules that are visible in the cytoplasm of leukocytes
*   **Morphological Features**
    *   Large, intensely staining azurophilic (purple-red) granules in all types of leukocytes
    *   Granules are typically larger and more prominent than normal granules
    *   Distinction from Toxic Granulation: Alder-Reilly granules are present in *all* types of leukocytes, while toxic granulation is usually limited to neutrophils
*   **Associated Conditions:** Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), a group of inherited metabolic disorders:
    *   Hurler syndrome (MPS IH)
    *   Hunter syndrome (MPS II)
    *   Sanfilippo syndrome (MPS III)
    *   Morquio syndrome (MPS IV)
*   **Clinical Features**
    *   Related to Mucopolysaccharidoses
    *   Skeletal abnormalities
    *   Mental retardation
    *   Hepatosplenomegaly
    *   Corneal clouding

        *   Demonstrate deficiency of the specific lysosomal enzyme that is affected in the particular mucopolysaccharidosis
    *   Genetic Testing:
        *   Can confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific mutation
*   **Treatment**
    *   Supportive care for the underlying mucopolysaccharidosis
    *   Enzyme replacement therapy is available for some MPS disorders
    *   Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be considered in some cases

    *   Giant granules in leukocytes, melanocytes, and other cells
    *   Partial albinism (skin and hair)
    *   Recurrent bacterial infections
    *   Neurological abnormalities
*   **Genetic Basis:** Caused by mutations in the *LYST* (also known as *CHS1*) gene, which regulates lysosomal trafficking
*   **Pathophysiology**
    *   Abnormal Lysosomal Trafficking: Defective LYST protein disrupts the normal fusion and trafficking of lysosomes and other organelles
    *   Giant Granule Formation: Leads to the formation of abnormally large granules in various cell types, including leukocytes, melanocytes, and nerve cells
    *   Impaired Function: The giant granules impair the normal function of these cells, leading to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome
*   **Morphological Features**
    *   Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Monocytes, and Lymphocytes: Contain giant granules that stain with Wright-Giemsa stain
    *   The granules are often irregular in shape and size
*   **Clinical Features**
    *   Partial Albinism: Light skin and hair color due to abnormal melanosomes
    *   Recurrent Bacterial Infections: Due to impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and killing
    *   Neurological Abnormalities: Peripheral neuropathy, seizures, developmental delay
    *   Accelerated Phase: Some patients develop an accelerated phase characterized by uncontrolled lymphocyte proliferation, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and pancytopenia
*   **Laboratory Findings**

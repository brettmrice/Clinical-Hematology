# Iron Deficiency {-}

## **Overview of Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A microcytic, hypochromic anemia characterized by decreased red blood cell production due to insufficient iron stores
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Inadequate iron intake
    *   Increased iron loss (bleeding)
    *   Impaired iron absorption
    *   Increased iron requirements (e.g., pregnancy)
*   **Epidemiology:** The most common cause of anemia worldwide, particularly affecting women of childbearing age, infants, and children
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Iron is essential for hemoglobin synthesis
    *   Insufficient iron leads to decreased hemoglobin production, resulting in smaller and paler red blood cells

## **Iron Metabolism** {-}

*   **Dietary Iron:**
    *   Sources: Heme iron (from animal products) and non-heme iron (from plant-based foods)
    *   Absorption: Heme iron is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme iron
*   **Iron Absorption:**
    *   Occurs primarily in the duodenum and proximal jejunum
    *   Non-heme iron is converted from ferric (Fe3+) to ferrous (Fe2+) form by duodenal cytochrome B reductase (DcytB)
    *   Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is transported into enterocytes by divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)
    *   Heme iron is transported into enterocytes by heme carrier protein 1 (HCP1)
*   **Iron Storage:**
    *   Within enterocytes, iron can be stored as ferritin or transported into the bloodstream by ferroportin
    *   Ferritin: The primary storage form of iron in cells (liver, spleen, bone marrow)
    *   Hemosiderin: An insoluble storage form of iron that accumulates when iron stores are excessive
*   **Iron Transport:**
    *   Ferroportin transports iron from enterocytes into the bloodstream
    *   In the bloodstream, iron is oxidized back to the ferric form (Fe3+) by hephaestin or ceruloplasmin
    *   Ferric iron (Fe3+) binds to transferrin, the iron transport protein
*   **Iron Delivery:**
    *   Transferrin transports iron to various tissues, including the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis
    *   Transferrin binds to transferrin receptors on cell surfaces, and iron is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis
*   **Iron Recycling:**
    *   Senescent red blood cells are phagocytized by macrophages in the spleen and liver
    *   Hemoglobin is broken down, and iron is released
    *   Iron is either stored as ferritin or transported back to the bone marrow by transferrin for new RBC production
*   **Regulation of Iron Metabolism:**
    *   **Hepcidin:** A hormone produced by the liver that regulates iron homeostasis
        *   Increased hepcidin levels: Inhibit iron release from enterocytes and macrophages by binding to ferroportin, leading to its internalization and degradation. This decreases iron availability in the circulation
        *   Decreased hepcidin levels: Promote iron release from enterocytes and macrophages, increasing iron availability in the circulation
    *   Hepcidin production is regulated by:
        *   Iron levels
        *   Inflammation
        *   Erythropoietic activity

## **Causes of Iron Deficiency Anemia** {-}

*   **Inadequate Iron Intake:**
    *   Dietary deficiency (especially in infants, children, and vegetarians)
    *   Malnutrition
*   **Increased Iron Loss (Bleeding):**
    *   Chronic blood loss (e.g., menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding)
    *   Acute blood loss (e.g., trauma, surgery)
    *   Frequent blood donations
*   **Impaired Iron Absorption:**
    *   Gastrectomy or bariatric surgery
    *   Celiac disease
    *   Inflammatory bowel disease
    *   Use of certain medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, antacids)
*   **Increased Iron Requirements:**
    *   Pregnancy
    *   Infancy and childhood (periods of rapid growth)
    *   Erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy

## **Clinical Manifestations of Iron Deficiency Anemia** {-}

*   **General Anemia Symptoms:**
    *   Fatigue
    *   Weakness
    *   Pallor (pale skin)
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Dizziness
    *   Headache
    *   Tachycardia
*   **Specific IDA Symptoms:**
    *   Pica (unusual cravings for non-food substances such as ice, dirt, or clay)
    *   Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails)
    *   Angular cheilitis (inflammation and cracking at the corners of the mouth)
    *   Glossitis (inflammation of the tongue)
    *   Plummer-Vinson syndrome (rare): Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), iron deficiency anemia, and esophageal webs

## **Laboratory Findings in Iron Deficiency Anemia** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Hemoglobin (HGB): Decreased
    *   Hematocrit (HCT): Decreased
    *   Red Blood Cell Count (RBC): Decreased or normal
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): Decreased (microcytic)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): Decreased (hypochromic)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): Decreased (hypochromic)
    *   Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW): Increased (anisocytosis - variation in RBC size)
    *   Platelet Count: May be normal or slightly elevated

## **Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia** {-}

*   **Identify and Treat Underlying Cause:**
    *   Address any sources of bleeding (e.g., treat ulcers, manage menorrhagia)
    *   Treat underlying conditions affecting iron absorption (e.g., celiac disease)
*   **Iron Supplementation:**
    *   Oral Iron:
        *   Ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, or ferrous fumarate
        *   Take on an empty stomach (if tolerated) to maximize absorption
        *   Vitamin C can enhance iron absorption
        *   Avoid taking with calcium, antacids, or tea, which can inhibit absorption
        *   Common side effects: Nausea, constipation, abdominal discomfort, and dark stools
    *   Parenteral Iron (Intravenous or Intramuscular):
        *   Used in patients who cannot tolerate oral iron, have severe malabsorption, or require rapid iron repletion
        *   Iron dextran, iron sucrose, ferric gluconate, or ferumoxytol
        *   Potential side effects: Allergic reactions, anaphylaxis (rare), and injection site reactions
*   **Dietary Modifications:**
    *   Increase intake of iron-rich foods (e.g., red meat, poultry, fish, legumes, dark leafy greens)
    *   Consume foods rich in vitamin C to enhance iron absorption
*   **Monitoring Response to Treatment:**
    *   Reticulocyte count: Should increase within 1-2 weeks of starting iron supplementation

# Protein C {-}

## **Overview of Protein C Assays** {-}

*   **Definition:** Laboratory tests used to measure the activity and/or concentration of Protein C, a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein, in plasma
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Diagnosis of Inherited Protein C Deficiency: Helps identify individuals with a genetic predisposition to thrombosis
    *   Evaluation of Thrombotic Events: Used to investigate patients with unexplained venous thromboembolism (VTE) or arterial thrombosis
    *   Assessment of Warfarin-Induced Skin Necrosis: Helps identify patients at risk of developing this rare but serious complication when starting warfarin therapy
    *   Differentiation of Thrombophilia Risk Factors: Used to determine if protein C deficiency is contributing to an increased risk of thrombosis
*   **Types of Assays:**
    *   Protein C Activity Assay (Functional Assay)
    *   Protein C Antigen Assay (Immunological Assay)

## **Protein C: Background and Function** {-}

*   **Protein C:**
    *   A vitamin K-dependent serine protease synthesized in the liver
    *   Circulates in the blood in an inactive form
*   **Activation of Protein C:**
    *   Thrombin binds to thrombomodulin, an endothelial cell receptor
    *   The thrombin-thrombomodulin complex activates protein C to Activated Protein C (APC)
*   **Anticoagulant Function of APC:**
    *   Activated Protein C (APC), along with its cofactor Protein S, inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa, inhibiting thrombin generation
    *   APC also promotes fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)

## **Types of Protein C Deficiency** {-}

*   **Type I (Quantitative Deficiency):**
    *   Reduced production of Protein C, resulting in decreased levels of both Protein C activity and antigen
    *   Caused by mutations that affect protein synthesis or secretion
*   **Type II (Qualitative Deficiency):**
    *   Normal levels of Protein C protein, but the Protein C molecule is dysfunctional
    *   Normal Protein C antigen level but decreased Protein C activity
    *   Caused by mutations that affect the catalytic activity or cofactor binding of Protein C

## **Protein C Activity Assay** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Measures the functional activity of protein C in plasma
    *   Based on the ability of activated protein C (APC) to prolong the clotting time in a modified aPTT assay
    *   Patient plasma is mixed with a reagent containing thrombin and thrombomodulin to generate APC
    *   The ability of the generated APC to prolong the clotting time is measured
*   **Methods:**
    *   Clotting-Based Assay:
        *   APC Resistance Assay: Measures the ability of APC to prolong the aPTT in the presence of Factor V Leiden. *This is actually a test for Factor V Leiden, not Protein C. It's included because Protein C and Factor V interact, but the test itself detects Factor V Leiden.*
        *   Protein C Clotting Assay: Measures the ability of generated protein C to prolong the clotting time in a modified aPTT assay.
        *   These are now rarely used and have generally been replaced by chromogenic assays
    *   Chromogenic Assay:
        *   A synthetic chromogenic substrate that is cleaved by APC
        *   The amount of colored product released is measured spectrophotometrically
        *   The intensity of the color is proportional to the APC activity
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific assay being used
    *   Typically involves:
        1.  Preparing the patient plasma sample
        2.  Adding the reagents to activate protein C
        3.  Measuring the chromogenic activity to determine Protein Câ€™s function
*   **Reporting:**
    *   Reported as a percentage of normal or in IU/dL
    *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the laboratory and the assay used (e.g., 70-130%)
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Decreased Protein C Activity:
        *   Suggests Protein C deficiency
        *   Levels below the reference range indicate there is not a normal amount of Protein C

## **Protein C Antigen Assay** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Measures the amount of Protein C protein in the plasma, regardless of its function
    *   Based on immunochemical methods that use antibodies specific for Protein C
*   **Methods:**
    *   Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):
        *   Microplate wells are coated with antibodies against protein C
        *   The sample is added to the wells, and any protein C present binds to the antibodies
        *   A secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme is added, which binds to the protein C-antibody complex
        *   A substrate for the enzyme is added, and the resulting color change is measured spectrophotometrically
    *   Immunoturbidimetric Assay:
        *   Antibodies against protein C are added to the sample
        *   As the antibodies bind to protein C, immune complexes form
        *   The turbidity of the solution is measured, which is proportional to the protein C concentration
*   **Procedure:**
    *   Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific assay being used
    *   Typically involves:
        1.  Preparing the patient plasma sample
        2.  Incubating the sample with the antibody reagent
        3.  Measuring the absorbance or turbidity to determine Protein C levels
*   **Reporting:**
    *   Reported as a concentration (e.g., mg/dL or IU/mL)
    *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the laboratory and the assay used (e.g., 70-130%)
*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Decreased Protein C Antigen: Suggests protein C deficiency
        *   Helps distinguish between type I (quantitative) and type II (qualitative) protein C deficiency
            *   Type I: Decreased antigen and activity
            *   Type II: Normal antigen, decreased activity

## **Interpreting Protein C Results** {-}

*   **Decreased Protein C Activity and Antigen:** Suggests a quantitative deficiency (Type I)
*   **Decreased Protein C Activity with Normal Protein C Antigen:** Suggests a qualitative deficiency (Type II)
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   Vitamin K Antagonists (e.g., Warfarin): Warfarin inhibits the production of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, including protein C, leading to decreased activity and antigen levels
        *   Patients should be off warfarin for at least 2 weeks before testing for protein C deficiency
    *   Acute Thrombosis: Protein C levels may be decreased during an acute thrombotic event due to consumption
        *   Testing should be performed after the acute event has resolved
    *   Liver Disease: Liver disease impairs the synthesis of protein C, leading to decreased activity and antigen levels
    *   Pregnancy and Oral Contraceptives: Can affect protein C levels

## **Factors Affecting Protein C Assay Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**

    *   Improper Collection Technique: Tissue thromboplastin contamination or hemolysis
    *   Incorrect Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: Underfilling or overfilling the collection tube
    *   Clotted Sample: Invalidates the results
    *   Delayed Testing: Protein C can degrade over time
    *   Improper Storage: Incorrect storage temperatures can affect results

*   **Analytical Variables:**

    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the coagulation analyzer
    *   Reagent Problems: Use fresh, properly stored reagents and follow the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Interfering Substances: Heparin can interfere with some protein C assays

*   **Patient-Related Variables:**

    *   Warfarin Therapy: Warfarin inhibits the production of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, including Protein C
    *   Acute Thrombosis: Protein C levels may be decreased due to consumption during a thrombotic event
    *   Liver Disease: Impairs the synthesis of Protein C
    *   Pregnancy and Oral Contraceptives: Can affect Protein C levels
    *   L-asparaginase therapy

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the protein C results are unexpected or inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation:

    *   Check the sample for clots or hemolysis
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Ensure that the correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio was used
    *   Verify the instrument and reagent quality control results
    *   Investigate potential interfering substances
    *   Review the patient's medication list and medical history
    *   Wait for a few weeks without anticoagulation therapy (if appropriate) to repeat testing

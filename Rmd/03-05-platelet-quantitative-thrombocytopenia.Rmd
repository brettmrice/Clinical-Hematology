# Thrombocytopenia {-}

## **Overview of Thrombocytopenia** {-}

*   **Definition:** A condition characterized by a decreased platelet count in the peripheral blood. Generally defined as a platelet count less than 150 x 10^9/L (150,000/ÂµL).
*   **Significance:** Thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, with the severity of bleeding correlating with the degree of platelet reduction.
*   **Classification:**
    *   Based on Mechanism:
        *   Increased Platelet Destruction (Immune and Non-Immune)
        *   Decreased Platelet Production
        *   Sequestration (less common)
        *   Dilutional
        *   Pseudothrombocytopenia (Spurious Thrombocytopenia)
    *   Based on Severity:
        *   Mild Thrombocytopenia: 100-150 x 10^9/L
        *   Moderate Thrombocytopenia: 50-99 x 10^9/L
        *   Severe Thrombocytopenia: <50 x 10^9/L

## **Increased Platelet Destruction** {-}

*   **Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP):**
    *   **Definition:** An acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of platelets by autoantibodies

*   **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP):**
    *   **Definition:** A life-threatening disorder characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), leading to microvascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia

*   **Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT):**
    *   **Definition:** A prothrombotic disorder caused by antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes

## **Decreased Platelet Production** {-}

*   **Bone Marrow Failure:**
*   **Medications:**

## **Pseudothrombocytopenia (Spurious Thrombocytopenia)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A falsely low platelet count due to in vitro platelet clumping or satellitism

## **General Laboratory Tests** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Peripheral Blood Smear:** Essential for diagnosing and classifying thrombocytopenia
*   **Reticulocyte Count:** Assesses bone marrow response
*   **Coagulation Studies (PT, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-dimer):** To evaluate for DIC
*   **Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT):** To evaluate for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Evans syndrome)
*   **HIV Testing:** To rule out HIV-associated thrombocytopenia
*   **Hepatitis C Testing:** To rule out hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia
*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:** May be necessary to evaluate for bone marrow disorders (e.g., aplastic anemia, MDS)
*   **ADAMTS13 Activity Assay:** To diagnose TTP
*   **HIT Antibody Testing:** To diagnose heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Thrombocytopenia:** Decreased platelet count
*   **Purpura:** Bruising due to bleeding under the skin
*   **Petechiae:** Small, pinpoint hemorrhages
*   **Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP):** Autoimmune destruction of platelets
*   **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP):** Thrombotic microangiopathy due to ADAMTS13 deficiency
*   **Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT):** Thrombocytopenia caused by antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes
*   **Schistocytes:** Fragmented red blood cells (seen in TTP and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias)
*   **Pseudothrombocytopenia:** Falsely low platelet count due to in vitro platelet clumping or satellitism
*   **Megakaryocytes:** Bone marrow cells that produce platelets

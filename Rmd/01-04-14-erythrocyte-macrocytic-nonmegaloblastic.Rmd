## **Overview of Non-Megaloblastic Macrocytic Anemias** {-}

*   **Definition:** Macrocytic anemias (MCV > 100 fL) that are *not* caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. In other words, they are *not* megaloblastic anemias. The macrocytosis is due to other mechanisms affecting RBC size.
*   **Key Feature:** Macrocytosis (large RBCs), *without* the typical morphological changes seen in megaloblastic anemia (i.e., *no* hypersegmented neutrophils or oval macrocytes). Bone marrow examination (if performed) will *not* show megaloblasts.
*   **Common Causes:**
    *   Alcoholism
    *   Liver Disease
    *   Hypothyroidism
    *   Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
    *   Reticulocytosis
    *   Medications

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

The exact mechanisms leading to macrocytosis in these anemias are complex and may vary depending on the underlying cause. Some common mechanisms include:

*   **Altered Lipid Metabolism:**
    *   Alcohol and liver disease can disrupt lipid metabolism, leading to increased cholesterol deposition in the RBC membrane
    *   This increases the surface area of the RBC membrane, resulting in a larger cell size (macrocytosis)
*   **Accelerated Erythropoiesis:**
    *   In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., hemolysis, acute blood loss), there is an increased number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood
    *   Reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs, so a high reticulocyte count can increase the MCV, leading to macrocytosis
*   **Membrane Abnormalities:**
    *   Hypothyroidism can alter RBC membrane composition, leading to increased cell size
*   **Clonal Hematopoiesis:**
    *   In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), abnormal stem cells in the bone marrow produce dysplastic blood cells, including macrocytes

## **Etiology and Associated Conditions** {-}

*   **Alcoholism:**
    *   Most common cause of non-megaloblastic macrocytosis
    *   Alcohol can directly affect RBC membrane lipids and also lead to folate deficiency (contributing to a mixed picture)
*   **Liver Disease:**
    *   Altered lipid metabolism and increased cholesterol deposition in RBC membranes
    *   Also, can be associated with spur cell anemia (acanthocytes)
*   **Hypothyroidism:**
    *   Decreased thyroid hormone affects RBC membrane composition and slows down erythropoiesis
*   **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):**
    *   Clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with dysplastic changes in one or more cell lines
    *   Macrocytosis may be present due to abnormal maturation of erythroid precursors
*   **Reticulocytosis:**
    *   Increased number of reticulocytes in response to hemolysis or blood loss
    *   Reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs, increasing the MCV
*   **Medications:**
    *   Hydroxyurea: Interferes with DNA synthesis
    *   Azathioprine and other immunosuppressants: Can disrupt cell division
    *   Antiretroviral drugs (e.g., zidovudine): Can cause macrocytosis, especially in patients with HIV

## **Clinical Manifestations** {-}

*   **Symptoms of Anemia (if present):**
    *   Fatigue
    *   Weakness
    *   Pallor (pale skin)
    *   Shortness of breath
    *   Dizziness
*   **Other Symptoms Depend on the Underlying Cause:**
    *   Alcoholism: Liver disease, neuropathy, cognitive impairment
    *   Liver disease: Jaundice, edema, ascites, coagulopathy
    *   Hypothyroidism: Fatigue, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, cold intolerance
    *   Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS): Infections, bleeding, fatigue

## **Laboratory Findings** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Hemoglobin (HGB): Decreased (anemia)
    *   Hematocrit (HCT): Decreased
    *   Red Blood Cell Count (RBC): Decreased
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): Increased (macrocytic) > 100 fL
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): Increased
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): Normal
    *   Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW): Normal or Increased
    *   White Blood Cell Count (WBC): May be normal, decreased (leukopenia), or increased (leukocytosis), depending on the cause
    *   Platelet Count: May be normal, decreased (thrombocytopenia), or increased (thrombocytosis), depending on the cause
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
    *   Macrocytes: Large RBCs, typically round (not oval)
    *   Anisocytosis (variation in RBC size) and poikilocytosis (variation in RBC shape) may be present, but are *not* as prominent as in megaloblastic anemias
    *   *Absence* of hypersegmented neutrophils and *absence* of oval macrocytes (helps to rule out megaloblastic anemia)
    *   Other findings may be present, depending on the underlying cause:
        *   Acanthocytes (spur cells) in liver disease
        *   Target cells
        *   Schistocytes (in some cases of MDS)
*   **Reticulocyte Count:**
    *   May be low, normal, or elevated, depending on the underlying cause
*   **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:**
    *   Normal (rules out megaloblastic anemia)
*   **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):**
    *   Elevated in liver disease
*   **Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs):**
    *   Abnormal in hypothyroidism (low T4, high TSH)
*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:**
    *   Cellularity: Variable (can be normocellular, hypercellular, or hypocellular)
    *   Maturation: May show dysplastic changes in one or more cell lines (MDS)
    *   *Absence* of megaloblasts
    *   Cytogenetic Analysis: To detect chromosomal abnormalities in MDS
*   **Other Tests:**
    *   Reticulocyte count
    *   Liver and thyroid test panels

## **Differential Diagnosis** {-}

*   **Megaloblastic Anemias:**
    *   Vitamin B12 deficiency
    *   Folate deficiency
    *   Distinguished by *hypersegmented neutrophils*, *oval macrocytes* on peripheral smear, and abnormal B12/folate studies
*   **Hemolytic Anemias:**
    *   May cause macrocytosis due to increased reticulocytes
    *   Elevated reticulocyte count, elevated bilirubin and LDH, decreased haptoglobin
*   **Cold Agglutinin Disease:**
    *   Agglutinated red blood cells can falsely elevate MCV
*   **Medication Side Effects**

## **Treatment and Management** {-}

*   **Treat the Underlying Cause:** This is the most important aspect of management

    *   **Alcoholism:**
        *   Alcohol cessation
        *   Nutritional support (thiamine, folate, multivitamin)
    *   **Liver Disease:**
        *   Management of underlying liver disease (e.g., antiviral therapy for hepatitis, abstinence from alcohol)
        *   Supportive care (e.g., diuretics for ascites)
    *   **Hypothyroidism:**
        *   Thyroid hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine)
    *   **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):**
        *   Supportive care (transfusions, growth factors)
        *   Hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine)
        *   Lenalidomide (for MDS with deletion 5q)
        *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Discontinue offending medications (if possible)
*   **Supportive Care:**

    *   Folic acid supplementation
        *   Although folate deficiency is *not* the primary cause of non-megaloblastic macrocytosis, folate supplementation may improve RBC production and overall hematopoiesis. This is controversial, and should be undertaken only when there is a concern that there is a folate deficiency in addition to another condition
    *   Blood transfusions:
        *   To manage severe anemia

## **Overview of Platelet Function** {-}

*   **Definition:** Platelets (thrombocytes) are small, anucleate cell fragments that play a critical role in hemostasis (blood clotting), thrombosis (blood clot formation), and inflammation
*   **Primary Function:** To initiate and participate in the formation of a platelet plug at sites of vascular injury, thereby preventing excessive bleeding
*   **Secondary Functions:** Contributing to the coagulation cascade and fibrin clot formation
*   **Normal Platelet Count:** 150,000 - 450,000 /μL (150-450 x 10^9/L)
*   **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelet count < 150,000 /μL
*   **Thrombocytosis:** Platelet count > 450,000 /μL

## **Platelet Structure** {-}

*   **Plasma Membrane:**
    *   Phospholipid bilayer with embedded glycoproteins and receptors
    *   Glycocalyx: Outer coating containing glycoproteins that mediate adhesion to subendothelial matrix and other platelets
*   **Cytoplasm:**
    *   Granules:
        *   Alpha Granules: Contain clotting factors (e.g., fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor [vWF]), growth factors (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF]), and adhesion molecules (e.g., P-selectin)
        *   Dense Granules (δ-granules): Contain ADP, ATP, serotonin, and calcium
        *   Lysosomes: Contain hydrolytic enzymes
    *   Open Canalicular System (OCS): System of channels that connect the platelet interior to the external environment, facilitating the release of granular contents and increasing surface area
    *   Dense Tubular System (DTS): Storage site for calcium ions and enzymes involved in prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis
    *   Microtubules and Actin Filaments: Provide structural support and facilitate shape change, movement, and clot retraction

## **Key Steps in Platelet Function** {-}

1.  **Adhesion:**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Platelets adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix at sites of vascular injury
        *   Von Willebrand factor (vWF) acts as a bridge between the platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX/V receptor (GPIb/IX/V) and collagen in the subendothelium
        *   Other adhesion molecules: Collagen receptors (e.g., GPVI), integrins (e.g., α2β1)
    *   **Disorders of Adhesion:**
        *   Bernard-Soulier Syndrome: Deficiency of GPIb/IX/V complex, leading to impaired vWF binding
        *   von Willebrand Disease: Deficiency or dysfunction of vWF, leading to impaired platelet adhesion

2.  **Activation:**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Adhesion triggers platelet activation, leading to a cascade of intracellular signaling events
        *   Release of ADP and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) amplifies the activation process
        *   Activation leads to:
            *   Shape change: Platelets transform from discoid shape to spherical shape with pseudopodia (filopodia)
            *   Granule release (degranulation): Secretion of granular contents into the surrounding environment
            *   Increased expression of GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet surface
    *   **Key Receptors and Signaling Molecules:**
        *   ADP receptors (P2Y1 and P2Y12): Bind ADP, promoting platelet activation and aggregation
        *   Thromboxane A2 (TXA2): A potent platelet activator and vasoconstrictor, synthesized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase (COX) and thromboxane synthase
        *   Thrombin: A potent activator of platelets via protease-activated receptors (PARs)
        *   Collagen: Activates platelets via the GPVI receptor
    *   **Disorders of Activation:**
        *   Storage Pool Deficiencies: Deficiencies in platelet granules (e.g., dense granule deficiency, alpha granule deficiency)
        *   Gray Platelet Syndrome: Deficiency of alpha granules, leading to impaired platelet function

3.  **Aggregation:**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Activated platelets bind to each other, forming a platelet plug (primary hemostatic plug)
        *   The GPIIb/IIIa receptor (integrin αIIbβ3) on activated platelets binds to fibrinogen, which acts as a bridge between adjacent platelets
        *   This cross-linking of fibrinogen molecules promotes platelet aggregation
    *   **Disorders of Aggregation:**
        *   Glanzmann Thrombasthenia: Deficiency of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, leading to impaired platelet aggregation

4.  **Secretion (Release Reaction):**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Activated platelets release the contents of their granules (alpha granules and dense granules)
        *   ADP and TXA2 amplify platelet activation and promote further aggregation
        *   Serotonin contributes to vasoconstriction
        *   Clotting factors (e.g., fibrinogen, vWF) contribute to secondary hemostasis
    *   **Disorders of Secretion:**
        *   Storage pool deficiencies (e.g., Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)

5.  **Stabilization of the Platelet Plug:**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   The coagulation cascade is activated, leading to the formation of fibrin
        *   Fibrinogen binds to the activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors, forming a fibrin meshwork that stabilizes the platelet plug
        *   Clot retraction: Platelets contract, pulling the edges of the damaged vessel together and strengthening the clot
    *   **Role of Thrombin:** Thrombin is a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade and also a potent platelet activator, creating a positive feedback loop

## **Regulation of Platelet Function** {-}

*   **Prostacyclin (PGI2):**
    *   Produced by endothelial cells
    *   Inhibits platelet activation and aggregation
    *   Causes vasodilation
*   **Nitric Oxide (NO):**
    *   Produced by endothelial cells
    *   Inhibits platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation
    *   Causes vasodilation
*   **ADPase (CD39):**
    *   An enzyme on endothelial cells that degrades ADP, reducing platelet activation
*   **Thrombomodulin-Thrombin Complex:**
    *   Thrombomodulin binds to thrombin, changing its substrate specificity
    *   The thrombomodulin-thrombin complex activates protein C, which inactivates factors Va and VIIIa, inhibiting coagulation
*   **Inhibitory Receptors on Platelets:**
    *   Platelets express receptors that can inhibit platelet activation (e.g., FcγRIIB, GPVI)

## **Platelet Function Tests** {-}

*   **Platelet Count:**
    *   Measures the number of platelets in the blood
    *   Used to detect thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis
*   **Bleeding Time:**
    *   *Historical test* (now rarely used)
    *   Measures the time it takes for bleeding to stop after a standardized skin incision
    *   Prolonged bleeding time suggests a platelet disorder or von Willebrand disease
*   **Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100):**
    *   Measures platelet function under high shear stress
    *   Blood is passed through a small aperture coated with collagen and either epinephrine or ADP
    *   Measures the time it takes for a platelet plug to form and occlude the aperture (closure time)
    *   Prolonged closure time suggests a platelet disorder or von Willebrand disease
*   **Platelet Aggregation Studies:**
    *   Measures the ability of platelets to aggregate in response to various agonists (e.g., ADP, collagen, epinephrine, thrombin, arachidonic acid, ristocetin)
    *   Agonists are added to platelet-rich plasma, and the change in light transmission is measured as platelets aggregate
    *   Abnormal aggregation patterns can help identify specific platelet disorders
*   **Flow Cytometry:**
    *   Measures platelet surface markers (e.g., GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb/IX/V)
    *   Can assess platelet activation and binding of agonists
*   **Thromboelastography (TEG) and Thromboelastometry (ROTEM):**
    *   Viscoelastic tests that assess the overall hemostatic function of blood
    *   Measure the strength and elasticity of the developing clot
    *   Provide information about platelet function, coagulation factors, and fibrinolysis

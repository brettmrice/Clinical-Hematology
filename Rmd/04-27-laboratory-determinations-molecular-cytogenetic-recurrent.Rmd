## **Overview of Recurring Cytogenetic Abnormalities in Hematologic Malignancies** {-}

*   **Definition:** Recurring cytogenetic abnormalities are specific chromosomal changes (translocations, deletions, inversions, etc.) that are frequently observed in certain types of hematologic malignancies
*   **Importance in WHO Classification:**
    *   Diagnostic: The presence of certain recurring cytogenetic abnormalities is used as a defining criterion for specific subtypes of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloproliferative neoplasms in the WHO classification
    *   Prognostic: Many recurring cytogenetic abnormalities have prognostic significance, meaning they can help predict the likely outcome of the disease
    *   Therapeutic: Some genetic abnormalities are targets for specific therapies
*   **Testing Methods:**
    *   Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping): Traditional method for identifying chromosomal abnormalities
    *   Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH): Used to detect specific chromosomal abnormalities more rapidly and sensitively
    *   Molecular Testing (PCR, NGS): Can detect gene mutations and fusion genes that result from chromosomal rearrangements

## **Recurring Cytogenetic Abnormalities by WHO Classification** {-}

Here, we'll break down the key cytogenetic abnormalities associated with different types of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms according to the WHO classification. Please note that the WHO classification is updated periodically, so it's important to consult the most recent version for the most current information.

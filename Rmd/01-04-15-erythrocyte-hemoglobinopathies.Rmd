## **Overview of Hemoglobinopathies** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of inherited (genetic) disorders characterized by abnormalities in the structure or synthesis of hemoglobin (HGB)
*   **Genetic Basis:** Caused by mutations in the genes encoding the globin chains (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) of the hemoglobin molecule
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Structural Hemoglobin Variants:** Abnormal hemoglobin molecules due to amino acid substitutions or other structural changes in the globin chains (e.g., Hemoglobin S, Hemoglobin C)
    *   **Thalassemias:** Reduced or absent synthesis of one or more globin chains (see separate study guide on Thalassemias)
*   **Prevalence:** Common worldwide, particularly in populations from Africa, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Asia
*   **Clinical Significance:** Can range from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening conditions depending on the specific mutation and its effect on hemoglobin function and RBC survival

## **Normal Hemoglobin Structure and Types** {-}

*   **Hemoglobin (Hb):** A tetrameric protein found in red blood cells (RBCs) that is responsible for oxygen transport
*   **Structure:**
    *   Composed of four globin chains (two alpha-like and two beta-like)
    *   Each globin chain contains a heme molecule, which contains an iron (Fe2+) atom that binds to oxygen
*   **Normal Hemoglobin Types:**
    *   **Hemoglobin A (HbA):** α2β2 (two alpha and two beta chains). Predominant hemoglobin in adults (95-98%)
    *   **Hemoglobin A2 (HbA2):** α2δ2 (two alpha and two delta chains). Minor component in adults (2-3%)
    *   **Hemoglobin F (HbF):** α2γ2 (two alpha and two gamma chains). Predominant hemoglobin in fetuses and newborns. Normally <1% in adults

## **Structural Hemoglobin Variants** {-}

*   **Hemoglobin S (HbS) - Sickle Cell Anemia**
    *   **Genetic Defect:**
        *   A point mutation in the β-globin gene on chromosome 11
        *   Substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the 6th position of the beta-globin chain (β6 Glu→Val)
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   Under conditions of low oxygen tension, HbS molecules polymerize, forming long fibers that distort the RBC into a sickle shape
        *   Sickled RBCs are rigid, less deformable, and prone to:
            *   Vaso-occlusion: Blockage of small blood vessels, leading to tissue ischemia and pain
            *   Hemolysis: Premature destruction of sickled RBCs in the spleen
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   Sickle Cell Trait (HbAS):
            *   Heterozygous for HbS (one normal beta-globin gene and one HbS gene)
            *   Usually asymptomatic
            *   May experience hematuria or splenic infarction at high altitudes or during extreme exercise
        *   Sickle Cell Anemia (HbSS):
            *   Homozygous for HbS (two HbS genes)
            *   Severe chronic hemolytic anemia
            *   Vaso-occlusive crises: Painful episodes caused by blockage of blood vessels
            *   Acute chest syndrome: Vaso-occlusion in the lungs, leading to chest pain, fever, and respiratory distress
            *   Stroke: Vaso-occlusion in the brain
            *   Splenic sequestration: Sudden pooling of blood in the spleen, leading to severe anemia and hypovolemic shock
            *   Aplastic crisis: Temporary cessation of erythropoiesis due to parvovirus B19 infection
            *   Chronic organ damage: Affects the lungs, kidneys, heart, and bones
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**

            *   Polychromasia
            *   Nucleated RBCs (after splenectomy or in severe anemia)
        *   Reticulocyte Count: Elevated (often > 10%)
        *   Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:
            *   HbAS (Sickle Cell Trait): HbA (50-60%) and HbS (35-45%)
            *   HbSS (Sickle Cell Anemia): Predominantly HbS (80-95%) and elevated HbF (5-15%); HbA is absent
        *   Sickle Solubility Test:
            *   Positive: Detects the presence of HbS (not specific for sickle cell anemia)
            *   Used as a screening test
    *   **Diagnosis:**
        *   Based on clinical presentation, peripheral blood smear, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and genetic testing
    *   **Treatment:**
        *   Hydroxyurea: Increases HbF production, reducing sickling and vaso-occlusive crises
        *   L-glutamine: Reduces oxidative stress
        *   Crizanlizumab: Monoclonal antibody that prevents vaso-occlusion
        *   Voxelotor: Binds to hemoglobin and increases its affinity for oxygen, reducing sickling
        *   Pain Management: Analgesics for vaso-occlusive crises
        *   Vaccinations: To prevent infections (especially encapsulated organisms)
        *   Prophylactic Penicillin: In children to prevent pneumococcal infections
        *   Blood Transfusions: For severe anemia, acute chest syndrome, stroke, or other complications
        *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT): Potentially curative option
    *   Gene Therapy: Emerging therapeutic approach

*   **Hemoglobin C (HbC)**

        *   Substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at the 6th position of the beta-globin chain (β6 Glu→Lys)
    *   **Pathophysiology:**
        *   HbC molecules tend to crystallize within RBCs, leading to increased rigidity and premature destruction in the spleen
    *   **Clinical Features:**
        *   HbAC (Hemoglobin C Trait):
            *   Heterozygous for HbC
            *   Usually asymptomatic

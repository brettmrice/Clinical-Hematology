## **Overview of Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** An abnormal increase in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood, leading to an elevated hemoglobin (HGB) concentration and hematocrit (HCT) value
*   **Alternative Terms:** Polycythemia, erythremia
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Relative Erythrocytosis:** An apparent increase in RBC count due to a decrease in plasma volume
    *   **Absolute Erythrocytosis:** A true increase in the total red blood cell mass in the body
*   **Causes:** Can range from benign to life-threatening conditions
*   **Symptoms:** May be asymptomatic or present with a variety of symptoms, including headache, dizziness, fatigue, blurred vision, pruritus (itching), and thrombosis (blood clots)

## **Relative Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** An elevated hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (HGB) concentration due to a *decrease* in plasma volume, rather than an actual increase in red blood cell mass
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Dehydration:**
        *   Reduced fluid intake
        *   Excessive fluid loss (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, diuretic use, burns)
    *   **Stress Erythrocytosis (GaisbÃ¶ck Syndrome):**
        *   More common in middle-aged men who are obese, hypertensive, and smokers
        *   Underlying mechanism is not fully understood but may involve increased catecholamines, which lead to decreased plasma volume
        *   Often associated with anxiety and stress
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   Elevated HGB and HCT
    *   Normal red blood cell mass
    *   Elevated RBC count
    *   Normal or elevated serum protein and albumin levels (due to hemoconcentration)
    *   Normal or low-normal Erythropoietin level (EPO)
    *   Normal Oxygen Saturation (SaO2)

## **Absolute Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** A true increase in the total red blood cell mass in the body
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Primary Erythrocytosis:**
        *   Caused by intrinsic abnormalities of the bone marrow, leading to uncontrolled RBC production
        *   Independent of erythropoietin (EPO) levels
    *   **Secondary Erythrocytosis:**
        *   Caused by factors external to the bone marrow that stimulate increased RBC production
        *   Associated with elevated erythropoietin (EPO) levels

## **Primary Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Polycythemia Vera (PV):**
    *   A myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of all myeloid cell lines (RBCs, WBCs, and platelets), but with predominant increase in RBCs
    *   Cause: In most cases (>95%), caused by a mutation in the JAK2 gene (Janus kinase 2), which leads to constitutive activation of the EPO receptor signaling pathway
    *   Symptoms: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, pruritus (especially after a warm bath), erythromelalgia (burning pain and redness in the extremities), splenomegaly, and thrombosis (both arterial and venous)
    *   Laboratory Findings:
        *   Elevated HGB and HCT
        *   Elevated RBC count
        *   Normal or decreased EPO level
        *   Increased WBC count and platelet count in some cases
        *   Positive JAK2 mutation
        *   Bone marrow examination: Hypercellular marrow with increased erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic lineages

## **Secondary Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** Increased RBC production due to an underlying condition that stimulates erythropoietin (EPO) production
*   **Causes:**
    *   **Hypoxia-Induced Erythrocytosis:**
        *   Chronic lung disease (e.g., COPD, emphysema)
        *   High altitude
        *   Obstructive sleep apnea
        *   Cyanotic heart disease
        *   Reduced oxygen levels stimulate EPO production by the kidneys
    *   **EPO-Producing Tumors:**
        *   Renal cell carcinoma
        *   Hepatocellular carcinoma
        *   Hemangioblastoma
        *   These tumors secrete EPO, leading to increased RBC production
    *   **Other Causes:**
        *   Exogenous EPO administration (e.g., in athletes for performance enhancement)
        *   Androgen use
        *   Certain medications
        *   Post-kidney transplant erythrocytosis
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   Elevated HGB and HCT
    *   Elevated RBC count
    *   Elevated EPO level (except in cases of exogenous EPO administration)
    *   Normal or elevated WBC count and platelet count
    *   Arterial blood gas analysis: May show hypoxemia (low oxygen levels) in hypoxia-induced erythrocytosis
    *   Imaging studies: To detect EPO-producing tumors

## **Diagnostic Approach to Erythrocytosis** {-}

1.  **Confirm Erythrocytosis:**
    *   Check HGB and HCT levels
2.  **Rule Out Relative Erythrocytosis:**
    *   Assess hydration status
    *   Check serum protein and albumin levels
3.  **Measure Red Blood Cell Mass:**
    *   If available, direct measurement of RBC mass can differentiate between relative and absolute erythrocytosis
4.  **Measure Serum Erythropoietin (EPO) Level:**
    *   Low or normal EPO: Suggests primary erythrocytosis (e.g., PV)
    *   Elevated EPO: Suggests secondary erythrocytosis
5.  **If EPO is Low or Normal:**
    *   Test for JAK2 mutation (highly suggestive of PV)
    *   If JAK2 is negative, consider other myeloproliferative neoplasms or rare causes of primary erythrocytosis
    *   Bone marrow examination may be necessary
6.  **If EPO is Elevated:**
    *   Assess for hypoxia:
        *   Arterial blood gas analysis
        *   Pulse oximetry
    *   Evaluate for EPO-producing tumors:
        *   Imaging studies (e.g., CT scan, MRI)
    *   Consider other causes:
        *   Exogenous EPO administration
        *   Androgen use
        *   Other medications

## **Complications of Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Thrombosis:**
    *   Increased risk of blood clots due to increased blood viscosity and platelet activation
    *   Can lead to stroke, heart attack, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
*   **Bleeding:**
    *   Paradoxically, some patients with PV may experience bleeding due to abnormal platelet function
*   **Splenomegaly:**
    *   Enlargement of the spleen due to increased workload
*   **Myelofibrosis:**
    *   In PV, bone marrow can become fibrotic over time, leading to cytopenias
*   **Transformation to Acute Leukemia:**
    *   Small risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in PV, especially after treatment with certain agents

## **Treatment of Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Relative Erythrocytosis:**
    *   Address the underlying cause (e.g., rehydration)
*   **Polycythemia Vera:**
    *   Phlebotomy: To reduce HCT to <45%
    *   Low-dose aspirin: To reduce the risk of thrombosis
    *   Cytoreductive therapy:
        *   Hydroxyurea: To suppress bone marrow proliferation
        *   Ruxolitinib: A JAK2 inhibitor used in patients who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea
*   **Secondary Erythrocytosis:**
    *   Address the underlying cause:
        *   Oxygen therapy for hypoxia
        *   Surgical removal of EPO-producing tumors
    *   Phlebotomy: May be used to reduce Hct in symptomatic patients

## **Key Laboratory Tests for Erythrocytosis** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   HGB and HCT: Elevated
    *   RBC count: Elevated
    *   WBC count: May be normal or elevated
    *   Platelet count: May be normal or elevated
*   **Serum Erythropoietin (EPO) Level:**
    *   Low or normal: Suggests primary erythrocytosis
    *   Elevated: Suggests secondary erythrocytosis
*   **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis:**
    *   To assess oxygen saturation and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in hypoxia-induced erythrocytosis

    *   To diagnose polycythemia vera
*   **Bone Marrow Examination:**

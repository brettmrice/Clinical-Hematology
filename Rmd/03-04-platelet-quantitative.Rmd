## **Overview of Platelet Quantitative Abnormalities** {-}

*   **Platelets (Thrombocytes):** Small, anucleate cell fragments essential for hemostasis (blood clotting)
*   **Normal Platelet Count:** 150,000 - 450,000 /Î¼L (150-450 x 10^9/L)
*   **Quantitative Abnormalities:**
    *   Thrombocytopenia: Decreased platelet count
    *   Thrombocytosis: Increased platelet count
*   **Clinical Significance:** Abnormal platelet counts can lead to bleeding (thrombocytopenia) or thrombosis (thrombocytosis)
*   **Laboratory Evaluation:** Accurate platelet counting and peripheral blood smear examination are essential for diagnosis and management

## **Thrombocytopenia** {-}

*   **Definition:** A decreased platelet count, defined as a platelet count <150 x 10^9/L
*   **Classification:**
    *   Based on Mechanism:
        *   Decreased Platelet Production: The bone marrow is not producing enough platelets
        *   Increased Platelet Destruction: Platelets are being destroyed or consumed at an accelerated rate
        *   Sequestration: Platelets are trapped in the spleen
        *   Dilutional: As a result of blood transfusions or fluid administration.
    *   Based on Severity:
        *   Mild Thrombocytopenia: 100-150 x 10^9/L
        *   Moderate Thrombocytopenia: 50-100 x 10^9/L
        *   Severe Thrombocytopenia: <50 x 10^9/L
*   **Pseudothrombocytopenia:** A falsely low platelet count due to platelet clumping in the presence of EDTA anticoagulant

## **Causes of Thrombocytopenia** {-}

*   **Decreased Platelet Production:**
    *   Bone Marrow Disorders:
        *   Aplastic Anemia: Bone marrow failure with decreased production of all blood cell lines
        *   Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS): Dysplastic changes in megakaryocytes leading to impaired platelet production
        *   Leukemia: Infiltration of the bone marrow by leukemic cells, crowding out normal megakaryocytes
        *   Myelofibrosis: Scarring of the bone marrow, impairing megakaryopoiesis
    *   Infections:
        *   Viral Infections: Parvovirus B19, HIV, hepatitis C
        *   Bacterial Infections: Sepsis
    *   Nutritional Deficiencies:
        *   Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency (megaloblastic anemia)
        *   Iron deficiency
    *   Alcohol Abuse:
        *   Direct toxic effect on megakaryocytes
    *   Medications:
        *   Chemotherapy
        *   Thiazide diuretics
        *   Alcohol abuse
        *   Others
*   **Increased Platelet Destruction:**
    *   Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP):
        *   Autoantibodies (usually IgG) bind to platelet surface antigens, leading to their destruction by the spleen
        *   Can be acute (often in children after viral infection) or chronic (more common in adults)
        *   Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA):
            *   The RBC is also destroyed
            *   Evans Syndrome is having an AIHA and Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP) at the same time
        *   Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia:
            *   Certain drugs (e.g., heparin, quinine, sulfonamides) can induce antibody formation that leads to platelet destruction
        *   Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT):
            *   Antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex, leading to platelet activation and thrombosis
    *   Thrombotic Microangiopathies (TMAs):
        *   Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP):
            *   Deficiency of ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF)
            *   Large vWF multimers accumulate in the microvasculature, leading to platelet activation, microthrombi formation, and organ damage
            *   PENTAD: Thrombocytopenia, Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia (MAHA), Neurologic Abnormalities, Fever, and Renal abnormalities.
        *   Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS):
            *   Primarily caused by Shiga toxin-producing *Escherichia coli* (STEC-HUS)
            *   Shiga toxin damages endothelial cells in the kidneys, leading to platelet activation, microthrombi formation, and renal failure
            *   Triad: Thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and acute kidney injury
        *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):
            *   Systemic activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, leading to consumption of platelets and clotting factors
            *   Caused by infection, trauma, malignancy, or obstetric complications
    *   HELLP Syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelet Count):
        *   A complication of pregnancy characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia
    *   Post-Transfusion Purpura (PTP):
        *   Rare, delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction in which the patient develops antibodies against platelet antigens, leading to thrombocytopenia

*   **Sequestration:**

    *   Hypersplenism: Enlargement of the spleen, leading to increased trapping and destruction of platelets

*   **Dilutional:**

    *   Massive transfusion or fluid resuscitation may cause dilutional thrombocytopenia

# Myeloid {-}

## **Overview of Benign Myeloid Disorders** {-}

*   **Definition:** Non-cancerous conditions affecting the myeloid lineage of leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Usually reactive (secondary) to an underlying condition, rather than being primary disorders of the bone marrow.
    *   Often transient, resolving when the underlying cause is addressed.
    *   Generally, do not involve clonal proliferation or significant dysplasia (abnormal cell development).

## **Quantitative Changes in Benign Myeloid Disorders** {-}

Quantitative changes refer to alterations in the *number* of specific types of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood.

*   **Neutrophilia:** Increased number of neutrophils in the blood (Absolute Neutrophil Count > 7.7 x 10^9/L in adults)

    *   **Causes:**
        *   **Infections:** Bacterial infections are the most common cause of neutrophilia
        *   **Inflammation:** Tissue injury, surgery, burns, autoimmune diseases
        *   **Stress:** Emotional stress, exercise
        *   **Medications:** Corticosteroids, lithium
        *   **Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs):** *Must be ruled out, but are not considered "benign"*
        *   **Physiologic:** Newborns and pregnant patients will have slightly higher ranges
    *   **Mechanisms:**
        *   Increased release of neutrophils from the bone marrow storage pool
        *   Increased production of neutrophils in the bone marrow (stimulated by G-CSF and other cytokines)
        *   Decreased migration of neutrophils into tissues
    *   **Leukemoid Reaction:** An extreme neutrophilic response (WBC count > 50 x 10^9/L) that mimics leukemia.
        *   *Key Features:*
            *   Absence of blasts in the peripheral blood
            *   Elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score (see below)
            *   Lack of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   Elevated WBC count
        *   Increased absolute neutrophil count

*   **Neutropenia:** Decreased number of neutrophils in the blood (Absolute Neutrophil Count < 2.0 x 10^9/L in adults)

    *   **Causes:**
        *   **Drug-Induced:** Chemotherapy, antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), anticonvulsants
        *   **Infections:** Viral infections (e.g., influenza, HIV), severe bacterial infections (sepsis)

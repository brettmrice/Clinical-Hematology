# Thalassemias {-}

## **Overview of Thalassemias** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of inherited (genetic) blood disorders characterized by decreased or absent synthesis of one or more of the globin chains (alpha or beta) that make up hemoglobin
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Reduced globin chain synthesis leads to:
        *   Decreased hemoglobin production, resulting in microcytic, hypochromic anemia
        *   Imbalance in globin chain ratios, leading to precipitation of excess globin chains within red blood cell precursors, causing cellular damage and premature destruction (ineffective erythropoiesis)
*   **Classification:** Based on the affected globin chain:
    *   Alpha (α) Thalassemia: Decreased or absent synthesis of alpha-globin chains
    *   Beta (β) Thalassemia: Decreased or absent synthesis of beta-globin chains
*   **Severity:** Varies widely depending on the specific genetic defect and the number of affected genes

## **Genetics and Molecular Basis** {-}

*   **Globin Genes:**
    *   Alpha-globin genes: Located on chromosome 16 (two α-globin genes: αα/αα)
    *   Beta-globin gene: Located on chromosome 11 (one β-globin gene: β/β)
*   **Inheritance:**
    *   Autosomal recessive: Both parents must carry the affected gene for the child to inherit the disease
    *   Carriers: Individuals with one affected gene are usually asymptomatic (thalassemia trait or minor)
*   **Mutations:**
    *   Alpha-thalassemia: Usually caused by gene deletions
    *   Beta-thalassemia: Usually caused by point mutations or small insertions/deletions
*   **Nomenclature:**
    *   Normal: αα/αα (alpha), β/β (beta)
    *   Trait/Minor: α-/αα or - -/αα (alpha), β/βo or β/β+ (beta)
    *   Major/Disease: α-/--, --/-- (alpha), βo/βo, β+/βo, β+/β+ (beta)
    *   Hemoglobin H disease: --/αα (alpha). Excess beta chains form HbH tetramers
    *   Hydrops fetalis: --/-- (alpha). No alpha chains are produced, incompatible with life
    *   βo: No beta-globin chain production
    *   β+: Reduced beta-globin chain production

## **Alpha (α) Thalassemia** {-}

*   **Genetic Basis:** Decreased or absent synthesis of alpha-globin chains
*   **Severity:** Depends on the number of affected alpha-globin genes
*   **Clinical Syndromes:**
    *   Silent Carrier (αα/α-):
        *   One alpha-globin gene is deleted or mutated
        *   Usually asymptomatic
        *   Can be diagnosed by genetic testing
    *   Alpha-Thalassemia Trait (α- /α- or αα/--):
        *   Two alpha-globin genes are deleted or mutated
        *   Mild microcytic, hypochromic anemia
        *   May have slightly decreased MCV and MCH
        *   Diagnosis is often made by exclusion of other causes of microcytic anemia
    *   Hemoglobin H Disease (--/αα):
        *   Three alpha-globin genes are deleted or mutated
        *   Moderate to severe microcytic, hypochromic anemia
        *   Peripheral blood smear: Microcytes, hypochromia, target cells, and HbH inclusions (use brilliant cresyl blue stain)
        *   HbH inclusions: Precipitated excess beta-globin chains
    *   Hydrops Fetalis (--/--):
        *   All four alpha-globin genes are deleted or mutated
        *   No alpha-globin chain production
        *   Incompatible with life
        *   Results in severe anemia, edema, and heart failure in the fetus
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC: Decreased HGB, HCT, and MCV
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear: Microcytes, hypochromia, target cells, and poikilocytosis
    *   Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:
        *   Silent carrier: Usually normal
        *   Alpha-thalassemia trait: Usually normal
        *   HbH disease: Presence of HbH (fast-migrating band)
        *   Hydrops fetalis: Predominantly Hb Bart's (gamma tetramers) in fetal blood
    *   Iron Studies: Normal or elevated (not iron deficient)
    *   Genetic Testing: Confirms the diagnosis by detecting alpha-globin gene deletions or mutations

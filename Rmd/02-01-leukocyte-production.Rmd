## **Overview of Leukocyte Production** {-}

*   **Definition:** The process of white blood cell (leukocyte) production, development, and maturation in the bone marrow and, for lymphocytes, also in secondary lymphoid organs
*   **Purpose:** To maintain an adequate supply of functional leukocytes to defend the body against infection, inflammation, and other threats.
*   **Regulation:** Complex interplay of growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors
*   **Location:** Primarily occurs in the bone marrow, except for lymphocytes, which also undergo maturation and differentiation in the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen)
*   **Types of Leukocytes:**
    *   Granulocytes: Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils
    *   Monocytes
    *   Lymphocytes: T lymphocytes (T cells), B lymphocytes (B cells), and natural killer (NK) cells

## **Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) and Leukocyte Development** {-}

*   **Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs):**
    *   Self-renewing cells that can differentiate into all blood cell lineages
    *   Reside in the bone marrow
*   **Common Myeloid Progenitor (CMP):**
    *   Gives rise to granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and megakaryocytes
*   **Common Lymphoid Progenitor (CLP):**
    *   Gives rise to lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and NK cells)

*   **Promyelocyte:**
    *   Large cell with a slightly lower N:C ratio than myeloblast
    *   Primary (azurophilic) granules appear in the cytoplasm
    *   Primary granules contain enzymes and other substances involved in killing and digesting microorganisms (e.g., myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, elastase)
*   **Myelocyte:**
    *   Smaller than promyelocyte
    *   Nucleus is round and eccentric
    *   Secondary (specific) granules appear in the cytoplasm
        *   Neutrophilic myelocyte: Produces neutrophilic granules (stain pink or lavender)
        *   Eosinophilic myelocyte: Produces eosinophilic granules (stain orange-red)
        *   Basophilic myelocyte: Produces basophilic granules (stain dark blue or purple)
    *   "Dawn of neutrophilia": Refers to the appearance of pinkish cytoplasm in neutrophilic myelocytes

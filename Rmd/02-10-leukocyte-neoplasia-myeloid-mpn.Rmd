## **Overview of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by *increased* proliferation of one or more myeloid cell lines in the bone marrow
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Increased Blood Cell Counts: Elevated WBC count, RBC count, and/or platelet count
    *   Extramedullary Hematopoiesis: Hematopoiesis (blood cell production) occurs outside the bone marrow, often in the spleen (leading to splenomegaly) and liver
    *   Risk of Thrombosis and Bleeding: Due to abnormal platelet function and/or elevated blood cell counts
    *   Risk of Transformation: Can progress to myelofibrosis (scarring of the bone marrow) or acute leukemia
*   **Diagnostic Hallmark:** MPNs are often characterized by specific genetic mutations that drive the increased proliferation
*   **Classification:**
    *   Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
    *   Polycythemia Vera (PV)
    *   Essential Thrombocythemia (ET)
    *   Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)
    *   Other, rarer MPNs

## **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of the *BCR-ABL1* fusion gene, resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2))
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   *BCR-ABL1 Fusion Gene:* The translocation creates the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph chromosome) and results in the fusion of the *BCR* gene on chromosome 22 with the *ABL1* gene on chromosome 9
    *   *Constitutive Tyrosine Kinase Activity:* The BCR-ABL1 fusion protein has constitutive (always "on") tyrosine kinase activity, which drives uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells
*   **Phases of CML:**
    *   Chronic Phase (CP):
        *   Relatively indolent phase with increased WBC count, but <10% blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood
    *   Accelerated Phase (AP):
        *   Increasing WBC count, blasts between 10-19% in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, resistance to treatment, new cytogenetic abnormalities
    *   Blast Phase (BP):
        *   Transformation to acute leukemia (either myeloid or lymphoid) with ≥20% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Chronic Phase:
        *   Often asymptomatic
        *   Fatigue
        *   Splenomegaly
        *   Night sweats
        *   Weight loss
    *   Accelerated Phase and Blast Phase:
        *   Worsening symptoms
        *   Fever
        *   Bone pain
        *   Bleeding
        *   Infections
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Elevated WBC count (often > 25 x 10^9/L)
        *   Neutrophilia with a "left shift" (increased band neutrophils, metamyelocytes, and myelocytes)
        *   Basophilia
        *   Eosinophilia
        *   Anemia (variable)
        *   Platelet count: Normal or elevated
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Increased granulocytes at various stages of maturation
        *   Basophilia
        *   Small number of blasts (in chronic phase)
        *   Presence of blasts and promyelocytes (in accelerated and blast phases)
    *   Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:
        *   Hypercellular marrow with increased granulopoiesis
        *   Myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio is increased
        *   Blast percentage: <10% in chronic phase, 10-19% in accelerated phase, and ≥20% in blast phase
    *   Cytogenetic Analysis:
        *   Philadelphia chromosome (Ph chromosome): t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2)
    *   Molecular Testing:
        *   BCR-ABL1 Fusion Gene: Detected by PCR or FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization)
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs):
        *   Imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib
        *   Target the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase activity, leading to apoptosis of leukemic cells
        *   Highly effective in achieving and maintaining remission in most patients with chronic phase CML
    *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):
        *   Potentially curative option
        *   Typically reserved for patients who fail TKI therapy or who are in accelerated or blast phase
    *   Interferon-alpha:
        *   An older treatment option that is now less commonly used

## **Polycythemia Vera (PV)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by increased production of red blood cells (erythrocytosis), often accompanied by increased production of white blood cells and platelets
*   **Diagnostic Criteria:**
    *   Elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit
    *   Presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation (or other *JAK2* exon 12 mutation)
    *   Bone marrow showing erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   *JAK2 Mutation:* A mutation in the *JAK2* gene (Janus kinase 2), most commonly the V617F mutation
        *   JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction for several growth factors, including erythropoietin (EPO)
        *   The *JAK2* mutation leads to constitutive activation of the EPO receptor signaling pathway, resulting in uncontrolled RBC production, independent of EPO levels
    *   *Erythroid Progenitor Hypersensitivity:* Erythroid progenitors become hypersensitive to growth factors
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Elevated red cell mass is what causes:
        *   Headache
        *   Dizziness
        *   Fatigue
        *   Blurred Vision
        *   Pruritus (itching, especially after a warm bath)
        *   Erythromelalgia (burning pain and redness in the extremities)
        *   Thrombosis: Increased risk of blood clots (stroke, heart attack, pulmonary embolism, DVT)
        *   Bleeding: Paradoxically, some patients may experience bleeding due to abnormal platelet function
        *   Splenomegaly: Enlarged spleen

*   **Diagnostic Criteria:**
    *   Sustained Platelet Count ≥450 x 10^9/L
    *   Bone Marrow Showing Increased Numbers of Megakaryocytes
    *   Exclusion of Other MPNs: Absence of criteria for PV, PMF, or CML
    *   Presence of a Clonal Marker (e.g., JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation) or Evidence of Clonal Hematopoiesis in the Absence of Other Causes of Thrombocytosis
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Mutations in *JAK2*, *CALR*, or *MPL* genes lead to increased megakaryocyte proliferation and platelet production
        *   *JAK2* mutation (Janus kinase 2): Affects signal transduction
        *   *CALR* mutation (calreticulin): Affects protein folding and calcium signaling

*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Mutations in *JAK2*, *CALR*, or *MPL* genes lead to:
        *   Abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation and activation
        *   Release of cytokines (e.g., TGF-β, PDGF, VEGF) that stimulate fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition in the bone marrow
    *   Progressive bone marrow fibrosis impairs normal hematopoiesis, leading to:

    *   Constitutional Symptoms: Fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fever
    *   Bone Pain
    *   Thrombosis and Bleeding: Due to abnormal platelet function
*   **Laboratory Findings:**

*   **Treatment:**
    *   Supportive Care:
        *   Transfusions to manage anemia and thrombocytopenia
        *   Ruxolitinib: A JAK2 inhibitor that reduces spleen size, improves constitutional symptoms, and may prolong survival
        *   Danazol or thalidomide: May improve anemia or thrombocytopenia
        *   Hydroxyurea: To manage thrombocytosis or leukocytosis
    *   Splenectomy: May be considered for symptomatic splenomegaly or refractory cytopenias, but carries significant risks

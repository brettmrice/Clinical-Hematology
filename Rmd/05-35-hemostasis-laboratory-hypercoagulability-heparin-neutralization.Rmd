# Heparin Neutralization {-}

## **Overview of Heparin Neutralization Assays** {-}

*   **Definition:** Heparin neutralization assays are a group of laboratory tests used to determine if heparin is interfering with other coagulation assays or to assess the presence of heparin-induced antibodies

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Distinguishing between heparin contamination and true coagulation factor deficiencies in patients with prolonged clotting times (PT and/or aPTT)
    *   Investigating unexpected or unexplained bleeding
    *   Evaluating heparin responsiveness
    *   Detecting heparin-dependent antibodies (e.g., in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - HIT)
    
*   **Two Main Categories:**
    *   Heparin Neutralization to Correct Clotting Assays: Used to determine if heparin is causing prolonged clotting times
    *   Heparin Antibody Assays: Used to detect and identify antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes, as in Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)

## **Heparin Neutralization to Correct Clotting Assays** {-}

*   **Principle:** These assays involve adding a heparin-neutralizing agent to the patient's plasma to inactivate any heparin present, and then repeating the prolonged clotting test (PT and/or aPTT)

*   **Rationale:** If the prolonged clotting time corrects after heparin neutralization, it suggests that the prolongation was due to heparin interference, rather than a true factor deficiency or inhibitor

*   **Methods:**
    *   Polybrene Neutralization:
        *   Polybrene is a positively charged compound that binds to and neutralizes heparin (which is negatively charged)
        *   Polybrene is added to the patient's plasma before performing the clotting assay (PT or aPTT)
    *   Protamine Sulfate Neutralization:
        *   Protamine sulfate is a positively charged protein that binds to and neutralizes heparin
        *   Protamine sulfate is added to the patient's plasma before performing the clotting assay (PT or aPTT)
    *   Heparinase Digestion:
        *   Heparinase is an enzyme that degrades heparin
        *   The patient's plasma is incubated with heparinase to remove heparin, and then the clotting assay is performed

*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Prepare the Patient's Plasma: Collect and prepare platelet-poor plasma (PPP) from the patient's blood sample
    2.  Perform Baseline Clotting Assay (PT or aPTT): Measure the PT or aPTT on the untreated patient plasma
    3.  Prepare the Neutralized Plasma:
        *   Add Polybrene, Protamine Sulfate, or Heparinase: Add the heparin-neutralizing agent to a portion of the patient's plasma, following the manufacturer's instructions
        *   Incubate: Incubate the neutralized plasma for the recommended time (usually a few minutes)
    4.  Perform the Clotting Assay on the Neutralized Plasma: Measure the PT or aPTT on the neutralized plasma
    5.  Compare Results: Compare the clotting time of the untreated plasma to the clotting time of the neutralized plasma

*   **Interpretation:**
    *   Correction of Clotting Time: If the clotting time corrects (returns to the normal reference range) after heparin neutralization, it suggests that heparin was the cause of the prolonged clotting time
    *   No Correction of Clotting Time: If the clotting time remains prolonged after heparin neutralization, it suggests that a factor deficiency or inhibitor is present, and heparin was not the sole cause of the prolonged clotting time

## **Heparin Antibody Assays (for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia - HIT)** {-}

*   **Overview:** These assays are used to detect antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes, which are characteristic of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

*   **HIT: A Quick Review:**
    *   HIT is a prothrombotic disorder caused by the formation of antibodies that bind to complexes of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4)
    *   Antibody binding activates platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and an increased risk of thrombosis
    
*   **HIT Diagnostic Algorithm**
    *   4Ts Score: Estimate clinical likelihood of HIT (Thrombocytopenia, Timing, Thrombosis, other causes for Thrombocytopenia)
    *   If score indicates high or intermediate likelihood of HIT, perform the following tests
    
*   **Assay Types**
    *   Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA):
        *   Principle: Detects antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes
        *   Procedure:
            *   Microplate wells are coated with heparin-PF4 complexes
            *   The patient's serum or plasma is added to the wells, and any antibodies present bind to the heparin-PF4 complexes
            *   An enzyme-labeled secondary antibody (e.g., anti-human IgG) is added, which binds to the bound antibodies
            *   A substrate for the enzyme is added, and the resulting color change is measured spectrophotometrically
        *   Interpretation:
            *   Optical Density (OD) values are measured, with a higher OD correlating to more antibodies present
            *   Can differentiate between IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies
            *   A positive result indicates the presence of heparin-PF4 antibodies, but does not confirm platelet activation
    *   Functional Assays:
        *   Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) and Heparin-Induced Platelet Aggregation (HIPA)
            *   Principle: Measures platelet activation in the presence of heparin and patient serum/plasma
            *   Procedure:
                *   Patient serum is incubated with normal donor platelets and heparin
                *   Platelet activation is measured by:
                    *   Serotonin Release Assay (SRA): Measuring the release of serotonin from platelets
                    *   Heparin-Induced Platelet Aggregation (HIPA): Measuring platelet aggregation
            *   Interpretation:
                *   Positive: Indicates the presence of platelet-activating antibodies, confirming HIT
        *   Advantages of Functional Assays:
            *   Higher specificity than ELISA
            *   Detect platelet-activating antibodies, which are more clinically relevant

*   **Pre-analytical:**
    *   Inappropriate sample type
    *   Clotted samples
    *   Improper handling or storage of the sample
    
*   **Analytical:**
    *   Kit and reagent performance
    *   Spectrophotometer functionality
    *   Reader alignment and accuracy

## **Troubleshooting** {-}
*   If the results are unexpected, repeat the test and ensure that all steps were performed correctly

## **Overview of Thrombocytopenia due to Decreased Production** {-}

*   **Definition:** A type of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) resulting from a *decreased* rate of platelet production by megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. The bone marrow simply isn't making enough platelets
*   **Key Feature:** The bone marrow is *hypoactive* (producing too few megakaryocytes) or *ineffective* (megakaryocytes are present but are not producing enough platelets). This can often be identified with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
*   **Reticulated Platelets:** Reticulated platelets, also known as immature platelets, are newly released platelets that contain RNA. A low count can correlate with a decreased rate of platelet production
*   **Etiology:** Can be caused by a variety of factors, including bone marrow disorders, infections, medications, and nutritional deficiencies
*   **General Mechanisms:**
    *   Damage or destruction of megakaryocytes (the platelet precursor cells in the bone marrow)
    *   Impaired megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation
    *   Disruption of thrombopoietin (TPO) signaling

## **Specific Causes of Thrombocytopenia due to Decreased Production** {-}

*   **Bone Marrow Failure or Infiltration**

    *   **Aplastic Anemia:**
        *   **Definition:** Bone marrow failure characterized by pancytopenia (decreased RBCs, WBCs, and platelets) and a hypocellular bone marrow
        *   **Pathophysiology:** Damage to or destruction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, leading to reduced production of all blood cell lines, including megakaryocytes
        *   **Causes:**
            *   Acquired:
                *   Idiopathic (most common) - thought to be autoimmune in many cases
                *   Drug-induced (e.g., chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, NSAIDs)
                *   Chemical exposure (e.g., benzene)
                *   Radiation exposure
                *   Infections (e.g., parvovirus B19, EBV, HIV)
                *   Autoimmune disorders
            *   Inherited:
                *   Fanconi anemia
                *   Dyskeratosis congenita
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**

            *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
                *   Normocytic, normochromic RBCs
                *   Absence of abnormal cells
            *   Reticulocyte Count: Low
            *   Bone Marrow Examination: Hypocellular marrow with decreased or absent hematopoietic cells (including megakaryocytes)

    *   **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):**
        *   **Definition:** A group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, dysplasia in one or more cell lines, and a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
        *   **Pathophysiology:**
            *   Genetic mutations impair the differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic cells, leading to cytopenias and dysplasia
            *   Dysplastic megakaryocytes may have abnormal morphology and decreased platelet production
        *   **Causes:**
            *   Acquired mutations in hematopoietic stem cells
            *   Risk factors: Advanced age, exposure to certain chemicals or radiation, prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy
        *   **Laboratory Findings:**

            *   Lenalidomide: Used for MDS with deletion 5q
            *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT): Potentially curative
    
    *   **Bone Marrow Infiltration:**
    
        *   Metastatic Cancer: Cancer cells from solid tumors can infiltrate the bone marrow, crowding out normal hematopoietic cells, including megakaryocytes
        *   Lymphoma: Infiltration of the bone marrow by lymphoma cells can suppress megakaryopoiesis
        *   Myeloma: Infiltration of the bone marrow by plasma cells in multiple myeloma can suppress megakaryopoiesis

            *   Peripheral Blood Smear: May show abnormal cells (e.g., tumor cells, lymphoma cells)
            *   Bone Marrow Examination: Evidence of infiltration by malignant cells

*   **Infection**

    *   **Viral Infections:**
    
        *   HIV: Can directly infect and damage megakaryocytes, leading to decreased platelet production
        *   Parvovirus B19: Can transiently suppress erythropoiesis and, less commonly, thrombocytopoiesis
        *   Other viral infections (e.g., EBV, CMV) can also cause thrombocytopenia through various mechanisms
    *   **Bacterial Infections:**
    
        *   Sepsis: Severe systemic infection can lead to bone marrow suppression and decreased platelet production

*   **Nutritional Deficiencies**

    *   **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:**
        *   Impaired DNA synthesis affects megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production
    *   **Folate Deficiency:**
        *   Impaired DNA synthesis affects megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production
    *   **Iron Deficiency Anemia:**
        *   Severe iron deficiency can impair megakaryopoiesis and platelet production

*   **Medications**

    *   Chemotherapy: Cytotoxic agents can damage megakaryocytes and suppress platelet production
    *   Alcohol: Chronic alcohol abuse can impair megakaryopoiesis
    *   Thiazide Diuretics: Can cause thrombocytopenia in some individuals

## **Key Laboratory Findings** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 x 10^9/L)
    *   May see other cytopenias (anemia and/or leukopenia), depending on the underlying cause
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
    *   Decreased number of platelets
    *   May see normal or abnormal platelets (depending on the cause)
    *   May see other abnormal cells (e.g., blasts, tumor cells, dysplastic cells)
*   **Reticulocyte Count:**
    *   In cases of isolated thrombocytopenia, the reticulocyte count will be normal
    *   If there is concurrent anemia, the reticulocyte count will help to classify the anemia:
        *   High reticulocyte count: Suggests increased RBC destruction or blood loss
        *   Low reticulocyte count: Suggests decreased RBC production
*   **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:**
    *   Essential for evaluating the cause of thrombocytopenia
    *   Assess cellularity of the bone marrow
    *   Evaluate megakaryocyte number and morphology
    *   Rule out bone marrow disorders (e.g., aplastic anemia, MDS, bone marrow infiltration)
*   **Other Tests:**
    *   Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels: To rule out nutritional deficiencies
    *   HIV Testing: To rule out HIV-associated thrombocytopenia
    *   HepC Testing: To rule out HepC-associated thrombocytopenia
    *   Parvovirus B19 PCR: To rule out parvovirus B19 infection

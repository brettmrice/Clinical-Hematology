## **Overview of Erythrocyte Destruction** {-}

-   **Purpose:** To remove aged or damaged red blood cells (RBCs) from circulation, preventing the release of potentially harmful intracellular components and recycling valuable components like iron
-   **Mechanisms:**
    -   **Extravascular Hemolysis:** The primary pathway, occurring mainly in the spleen and liver
    -   **Intravascular Hemolysis:** Occurs within the blood vessels
-   **Lifespan of a Normal RBC:** Approximately 120 days

## **Extravascular Hemolysis** {-}

-   **Location:** Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS); primarily in the spleen, but also in the liver and bone marrow
-   **Process:**
    1.  **Senescence (Aging):** As RBCs age, they undergo changes:
        -   Decreased flexibility
        -   Decreased enzyme activity
        -   Changes in membrane proteins
        -   Increased binding of antibodies and complement proteins
    2.  **Recognition by Macrophages:**
        -   Macrophages in the spleen recognize senescent or damaged RBCs based on surface markers (e.g., altered glycoproteins, bound antibodies)
    3.  **Phagocytosis:**
        -   Macrophages engulf the RBCs
    4.  **Hemoglobin Breakdown:**
        -   Within the macrophage, hemoglobin is broken down:
            -   **Globin:** Degraded into amino acids, which are recycled
            -   **Iron:** Stored as ferritin or hemosiderin within the macrophage, or transported to the bone marrow by transferrin for new RBC production
            -   **Heme:** Broken down into biliverdin, which is then converted to bilirubin
    5.  **Bilirubin Metabolism:**
        -   Bilirubin is released from the macrophage into the plasma, where it binds to albumin (unconjugated or indirect bilirubin)
        -   The albumin-bilirubin complex is transported to the liver
        -   In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid (conjugated or direct bilirubin)
        -   Conjugated bilirubin is excreted into the bile and then into the intestines
        -   In the intestines, bilirubin is converted to urobilinogen by bacteria
        -   Urobilinogen is either:
            -   Excreted in the feces (as stercobilin, which gives feces its brown color)
            -   Reabsorbed into the bloodstream and excreted in the urine (as urobilin, which gives urine its yellow color)
-   **Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS)**
    -   *Note: While "Reticuloendothelial System" is an older term, you'll still encounter it. The more modern and accurate term is the "Mononuclear Phagocyte System."*
-   **Definition:** The MPS is a diffuse network of phagocytic cells (primarily macrophages) located throughout the body, strategically positioned to filter blood and tissues, remove debris, and participate in immune responses.
-   **Key Components:**
    -   **Macrophages:** The main effector cells of the MPS. They are derived from monocytes and are capable of phagocytosis (engulfing and destroying particles).
    -   **Locations:** Macrophages are found in:
        -   **Spleen:** Red pulp macrophages are critical for filtering the blood and removing damaged or senescent RBCs.
        -   **Liver:** Kupffer cells (macrophages in the liver sinusoids) remove bacteria, debris, and old blood cells.
        -   **Bone Marrow:** Macrophages support erythropoiesis and remove cellular debris.
        -   **Lymph Nodes:** Macrophages filter lymph and present antigens to immune cells.
        -   **Lungs:** Alveolar macrophages clear debris and pathogens from the air spaces.
        -   **Connective Tissues:** Histiocytes (tissue macrophages) engulf debris and participate in inflammation.
-   **Functions:**
    -   **Phagocytosis:** Engulfing and destroying pathogens, cellular debris, and senescent or damaged cells.
    -   **Antigen Presentation:** Presenting antigens to T lymphocytes to initiate adaptive immune responses.
    -   **Cytokine Production:** Producing cytokines that regulate inflammation and immune responses.
    -   **Iron Recycling:** Recycling iron from senescent RBCs.
    -   **Lipid Metabolism:** Processing and metabolizing lipids.

**Splenic Functions: Pitting and Culling**

The spleen is a key organ of the MPS and plays a vital role in filtering the blood and removing abnormal RBCs. Two important splenic functions are pitting and culling:

-   **Culling:**
    -   **Definition:** The process by which the spleen removes *entire* senescent or damaged red blood cells from the circulation. This is complete phagocytosis and destruction of the RBC.
    -   **Mechanism:**
        -   As RBCs circulate through the splenic red pulp, they must squeeze through narrow interendothelial slits to re-enter the circulation.
        -   Senescent or damaged RBCs are less flexible and have difficulty passing through these slits.
        -   Macrophages in the spleen recognize and engulf these less deformable RBCs, leading to their complete destruction.
    -   **Outcome:**
        -   Removal of old or damaged RBCs, preventing them from causing harm.
        -   Breakdown of hemoglobin into its components (globin, iron, and porphyrin).
        -   Recycling of iron.
        -   Production of bilirubin (from porphyrin), which is then transported to the liver for excretion.
-   **Pitting:**
    -   **Definition:** The process by which the spleen removes *inclusions* or damaged components from RBCs *without* destroying the entire cell.
    -   **Mechanism:**
        -   As RBCs pass through the spleen, macrophages can "pluck out" certain inclusions from the RBCs, such as:
            -   Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants).
            -   Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin).
            -   Parasites (e.g., malaria).
            -   Iron granules (Pappenheimer bodies).
        -   The RBC membrane reseals after the inclusion is removed, allowing the RBC to continue circulating.
    -   **Outcome:**
        -   Removal of harmful inclusions from RBCs, improving their function and lifespan.
        -   RBCs can continue to circulate and transport oxygen.
    -   **Clinical Significance:**
        -   After splenectomy (removal of the spleen), patients may have increased numbers of RBCs with inclusions (e.g., Howell-Jolly bodies) in their peripheral blood, as the pitting function is lost.

**In Summary**

-   The Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS) is a network of phagocytic cells, primarily macrophages, that remove debris and participate in immune responses.
-   The spleen is a key organ of the MPS, responsible for filtering the blood.
-   **Culling** is the complete removal and destruction of senescent or damaged RBCs by splenic macrophages.
-   **Pitting** is the removal of inclusions from RBCs by splenic macrophages without destroying the entire cell.

## **Intravascular Hemolysis** {-}

-   **Location:** Within the blood vessels
-   **Causes:**
    -   Mechanical trauma (e.g., microangiopathic hemolytic anemia)
    -   Complement activation via immune-mediated
    -   Infections
    -   Toxic substances
-   **Process:**
    1.  **RBC Lysis:** RBCs rupture within the bloodstream, releasing hemoglobin directly into the plasma
    2.  **Hemoglobin Binding to Haptoglobin:**
        -   Free hemoglobin binds to haptoglobin, a plasma protein
        -   The hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation by the liver
    3.  **Hemoglobin Breakdown (When Haptoglobin is Saturated):**
        -   When haptoglobin is saturated, free hemoglobin can:
            -   Be oxidized to methemoglobin (Fe3+), which dissociates into globin and heme
            -   Heme binds to hemopexin, a plasma protein, and is transported to the liver
            -   Globin is broken down into amino acids
        -   Free hemoglobin can also be filtered by the kidneys:
            -   Some hemoglobin is reabsorbed by the renal tubules
            -   Excess hemoglobin is excreted in the urine (hemoglobinuria)
            -   Iron can accumulate in the renal tubular cells as hemosiderin (hemosiderinuria)

## **Key Enzymes and Proteins Involved** {-}

-   **Heme Oxygenase:**
    -   Enzyme that breaks down heme into biliverdin
-   **Biliverdin Reductase:**
    -   Enzyme that converts biliverdin to bilirubin
-   **UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT):**
    -   Enzyme in the liver that conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid
-   **Haptoglobin:**
    -   Plasma protein that binds free hemoglobin
-   **Hemopexin:**
    -   Plasma protein that binds free heme

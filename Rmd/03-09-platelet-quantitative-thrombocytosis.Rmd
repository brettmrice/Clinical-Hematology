# Thrombocytosis {-}

## **Overview of Thrombocytosis** {-}

*   **Definition:** An abnormally elevated platelet count in the peripheral blood, generally defined as a platelet count greater than 450 x 10^9/L (450,000/µL)
*   **Clinical Significance:** Thrombocytosis can increase the risk of thrombosis (blood clots) and, paradoxically, in some cases, bleeding
*   **Classification:**
    *   Reactive (Secondary) Thrombocytosis: The most common type, caused by an underlying condition
    *   Essential (Primary) Thrombocythemia: A myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by sustained thrombocytosis and increased risk of thrombosis and bleeding

## **Reactive Thrombocytosis (Secondary Thrombocytosis)** {-}

*   **Definition:** An elevated platelet count that occurs as a *reaction* to an underlying condition. It's not a primary disorder of the bone marrow
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Transient: Platelet count usually returns to normal once the underlying condition resolves
    *   Mild to Moderate Elevation: Platelet counts are typically less than 1000 x 10^9/L, but this is not a strict cutoff
    *   Lack of Clonal Marker: Absence of genetic mutations (e.g., JAK2, CALR, MPL) associated with essential thrombocythemia

*   **Common Causes of Reactive Thrombocytosis:**
    *   Infections:
        *   Acute and chronic bacterial infections
        *   Fungal infections
        *   Viral infections (less common)
    *   Inflammation:
        *   Autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease)
        *   Vasculitis
        *   Acute pancreatitis
        *   Tissue injury (e.g., trauma, surgery, burns)
    *   Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA):
        *   Platelet count may normalize after iron repletion
    *   Hemorrhage:
        *   Following acute blood loss, the platelet count may temporarily increase
    *   Splenectomy:
        *   Removal of the spleen leads to increased platelet counts, as the spleen normally removes senescent platelets
        *   Platelet counts can be very high (>1000 x 10^9/L) after splenectomy
    *   Rebound Thrombocytosis:
        *   Following recovery from thrombocytopenia caused by chemotherapy or bone marrow suppression
    *   Malignancy:
        *   Certain cancers (e.g., lung, breast, ovarian) can cause reactive thrombocytosis
    *   Medications:
        *   Corticosteroids
        *   Epinephrine

*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Increased Thrombopoietin (TPO) Production:
        *   Many of the underlying conditions associated with reactive thrombocytosis stimulate the production of thrombopoietin (TPO), the primary regulator of platelet production
        *   TPO is produced mainly by the liver and kidneys
        *   TPO stimulates megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation in the bone marrow, leading to increased platelet production
    *   Increased Release of Platelets from the Bone Marrow:
        *   Inflammatory cytokines can promote the release of platelets from the bone marrow storage pool
    *   Decreased Platelet Sequestration:
        *   Splenectomy removes the spleen, the main site of platelet destruction and sequestration, leading to increased platelet counts

*   **Clinical Features of Reactive Thrombocytosis:**
    *   Often asymptomatic
    *   Symptoms of the underlying condition may be present (e.g., fever, pain, inflammation)
    *   Thrombotic or bleeding complications are *rare* in reactive thrombocytosis, especially when platelet counts are <1000 x 10^9/L

*   **Laboratory Findings in Reactive Thrombocytosis:**
    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC):
        *   Elevated platelet count (usually < 1000 x 10^9/L)
        *   May see other abnormalities depending on the underlying cause (e.g., elevated WBC count in infection, anemia in iron deficiency)
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Increased number of platelets
        *   Platelets usually appear normal in size and morphology
        *   May see other abnormalities related to the underlying condition (e.g., microcytes in iron deficiency)
    *   Iron Studies:
        *   May be abnormal in iron deficiency anemia (low serum iron and ferritin, high TIBC)
    *   Inflammatory Markers:
        *   Elevated ESR, CRP, and/or other inflammatory markers
    *   JAK2, CALR, and MPL Mutation Testing:
        *   *Negative*: Helps to rule out essential thrombocythemia (ET)

## **Essential Thrombocythemia (Primary Thrombocythemia)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by sustained thrombocytosis and increased risk of thrombosis and bleeding. It's a primary disorder of the bone marrow
*   **Diagnostic Criteria (WHO Criteria):**
    *   Sustained Platelet Count ≥450 x 10^9/L
    *   Bone Marrow Showing Increased Numbers of Megakaryocytes with Abnormal Morphology
        *   Increased numbers of large, mature megakaryocytes with hyperlobated nuclei
    *   Exclusion of Other MPNs: Absence of criteria for PV, PMF, or CML
    *   Presence of a Clonal Marker or Evidence of Clonal Hematopoiesis:
        *   *JAK2* V617F mutation (present in approximately 50-60% of patients)
        *   *CALR* mutation (present in approximately 25% of patients)
        *   *MPL* mutation (present in approximately 5% of patients)
        *   If all three mutations are negative, other evidence of clonality is required
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Mutations in *JAK2, CALR, or MPL* Genes:
        *   These mutations lead to constitutive activation of signaling pathways that control megakaryocyte proliferation and platelet production
        *   *JAK2* V617F: A point mutation in the *JAK2* gene
        *   *CALR* mutations: Insertions or deletions in the *CALR* gene
        *   *MPL* mutations: Mutations in the *MPL* gene (thrombopoietin receptor)
    *   Megakaryocyte Hyperplasia: Increased numbers of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow
    *   Increased Platelet Production: Megakaryocytes produce excessive numbers of platelets
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis
    *   Thrombotic Events:
        *   Stroke
        *   Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
        *   Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
        *   Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
        *   Pulmonary embolism (PE)
        *   Erythromelalgia (burning pain and redness in the extremities)
    *   Bleeding Events:
        *   Paradoxically, some patients may experience bleeding due to abnormal platelet function
        *   Easy bruising
        *   Nosebleeds
        *   Gastrointestinal bleeding
    *   Splenomegaly: Enlarged spleen (less common than in PV or PMF)
    *   Constitutional Symptoms: Fatigue, night sweats, weight loss (less common)
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Elevated platelet count (sustained >450 x 10^9/L)
        *   WBC count: May be normal or slightly elevated
        *   RBC count: Usually normal, but may be slightly elevated
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Thrombocytosis (increased platelets)
        *   Large platelets (megathrombocytes)
        *   Abnormal platelet morphology (e.g., hypogranular platelets)
    *   Bone Marrow Examination:
        *   Increased numbers of megakaryocytes with abnormal morphology (e.g., large, hyperlobated nuclei)
        *   May see increased granulopoiesis
        *   Little or no reticulin fibrosis (unlike primary myelofibrosis)
    *   Molecular Testing:
        *   Positive for *JAK2*, *CALR*, or *MPL* mutation (in most cases)
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Low-Risk Patients (Low Risk of Thrombosis):
        *   Low-Dose Aspirin: To reduce the risk of thrombosis
    *   High-Risk Patients (High Risk of Thrombosis):
        *   Low-Dose Aspirin
        *   Cytoreductive Therapy:
            *   Hydroxyurea: To lower the platelet count
            *   Anagrelide: Inhibits platelet production
            *   Interferon-alpha: May be used in younger patients or pregnant women
    *   Risk Stratification:
        *   Various risk scoring systems are used to estimate the risk of thrombosis and guide treatment decisions

## **Overview of Leukocyte Function** {-}

*   **Definition:** Leukocytes (white blood cells) are essential components of the immune system, responsible for defending the body against infection, inflammation, and other threats
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Granulocytes:** Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils
    *   **Monocytes**
    *   **Lymphocytes:** T lymphocytes (T cells), B lymphocytes (B cells), and natural killer (NK) cells
*   **General Functions:**
    *   **Innate Immunity:** Immediate, non-specific defense mechanisms (e.g., phagocytosis, inflammation)
    *   **Adaptive Immunity:** Slower, antigen-specific immune responses mediated by lymphocytes

## **Granulocytes** {-}

*   **Neutrophils:**
    *   **Function:** Primary role in defense against bacterial and fungal infections
    *   **Mechanisms of Action:**
        *   **Phagocytosis:** Engulfing and destroying pathogens and debris
        *   **Degranulation:** Releasing antimicrobial substances from granules:
            *   Lysozyme: Breaks down bacterial cell walls
            *   Myeloperoxidase (MPO): Generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill pathogens
            *   Defensins: Antimicrobial peptides
            *   Elastase: Degrades bacterial proteins
        *   **Oxidative Burst:** Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill phagocytosed pathogens:
            *   NADPH oxidase: Enzyme responsible for generating superoxide (O2-)
            *   Superoxide dismutase (SOD): Converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
            *   Myeloperoxidase (MPO): Uses H2O2 and chloride ions to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl, bleach)
        *   **Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs):** Extruding a meshwork of DNA, histones, and antimicrobial proteins to trap and kill bacteria extracellularly
    *   **Chemotaxis:** Migration of neutrophils to sites of infection or inflammation in response to chemical signals (chemokines)
    *   **Clinical Significance:**
        *   Neutrophilia: Increased neutrophils, often seen in bacterial infections, inflammation, or stress
        *   Neutropenia: Decreased neutrophils, increasing susceptibility to infections
            *   Agranulocytosis: Severe neutropenia (ANC < 200 cells/μL)

*   **Eosinophils:**

# von Willebrand {-}

## **Overview of von Willebrand Disease (vWD)** {-}

*   **Definition:** The most common inherited bleeding disorder, characterized by a quantitative (amount) or qualitative (functional) defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF)
*   **Prevalence:** Estimated to affect 1-3% of the population, though many cases are mild and undiagnosed
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Mucocutaneous bleeding: Easy bruising, nosebleeds (epistaxis), gum bleeding, menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding)
    *   Prolonged bleeding after cuts, dental procedures, or surgery
*   **Genetic Basis:** vWD is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, although autosomal recessive inheritance is possible in some subtypes.
*   **Treatment:** Varies depending on the type and severity of vWD, and may include desmopressin, vWF/FVIII concentrates, and antifibrinolytic agents

## **von Willebrand Factor (vWF): Structure and Function** {-}

*   **vWF Structure:**
    *   A large, multimeric glycoprotein found in plasma, platelets, and subendothelial connective tissue
    *   Synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes
    *   Monomers of vWF are assembled into dimers, which then polymerize to form large multimers
    *   The size and structure of vWF multimers are critical for its function
*   **vWF Functions:**
    *   **Platelet Adhesion:
        *   vWF binds to exposed collagen in the subendothelium of damaged blood vessels
        *   vWF then binds to the platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX/V (GPIb/IX/V) receptor on the platelet surface, mediating initial platelet adhesion
        *   This interaction is crucial for platelet plug formation at sites of vascular injury, especially under high shear stress conditions
    *   **Factor VIII Carrier:
        *   vWF binds to factor VIII (FVIII), a coagulation protein
        *   vWF protects FVIII from degradation and prolongs its half-life in the circulation
        *   Decreased vWF can lead to decreased FVIII levels

## **Classification of vWD** {-}

*   **Type 1 vWD:** (60-80% of cases)

    *   Partial quantitative deficiency of vWF
    *   vWF is present, but in reduced amounts
    *   All vWF multimers are present, but in decreased concentration
    *   Inheritance: Usually autosomal dominant
*   **Type 2 vWD:** (20-30% of cases)

    *   Qualitative defects in vWF function
    *   vWF is present in normal or near-normal amounts, but its ability to perform its functions is impaired
    *   Subtypes:
        *   Type 2A:
            *   Decreased high-molecular-weight vWF multimers
            *   Impaired platelet adhesion
            *   Often caused by increased proteolysis or abnormal multimer assembly
        *   Type 2B:
            *   Increased affinity of vWF for platelets
            *   Spontaneous binding of vWF to platelets, leading to clearance of both vWF and platelets from the circulation, resulting in thrombocytopenia
            *   Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) is enhanced at low concentrations of ristocetin
        *   Type 2M:
            *   Decreased binding of vWF to platelets or collagen
            *   Normal vWF multimer distribution
            *   Differentiation of subtypes depends on which binding activity is affected (platelets or collagen)
        *   Type 2N:
            *   Decreased binding of vWF to factor VIII
            *   Markedly reduced factor VIII levels
            *   May be misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency)
    *   Inheritance: Usually autosomal dominant
*   **Type 3 vWD:** (Rare)
    *   Severe quantitative deficiency of vWF (vWF is virtually absent)
    *   Very low or undetectable levels of vWF and factor VIII
    *   Severe bleeding symptoms
    *   Inheritance: Autosomal recessive

## **Clinical Features** {-}

*   **Variable bleeding symptoms:**
    *   Severity of bleeding depends on the type and severity of vWD
    *   Bleeding symptoms may be mild and only become apparent after surgery or trauma
*   **Common Manifestations:**

    *   Nosebleeds (epistaxis)
    *   Easy bruising
    *   Prolonged bleeding after cuts or dental procedures
    *   Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) in women
    *   Postpartum hemorrhage
    *   Gastrointestinal bleeding (less common)
    *   Joint bleeds (hemarthrosis) are rare, unlike in hemophilia
*   **Symptoms by vWD Type:**

    *   Type 1 vWD: Mild to moderate bleeding symptoms
    *   Type 2 vWD: Variable bleeding symptoms, depending on the subtype
        *   Type 2A: Moderate bleeding symptoms
        *   Type 2B: Moderate bleeding symptoms; may also have thrombocytopenia
        *   Type 2M: Mild to moderate bleeding symptoms
        *   Type 2N: Moderate to severe bleeding symptoms; may be misdiagnosed as hemophilia A
    *   Type 3 vWD: Severe bleeding symptoms

## **Laboratory Diagnosis** {-}

*   **Screening Tests:**

    *   Complete Blood Count (CBC):
        *   Platelet count is usually normal, but may be decreased in some cases (e.g., type 2B vWD)
    *   Prothrombin Time (PT): Usually normal
    *   Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): May be prolonged if factor VIII is significantly reduced (especially in type 2N and type 3 vWD)

*   **Specific vWD Assays:**

    *   von Willebrand Factor Antigen (vWF:Ag):
        *   Measures the amount of vWF protein in the plasma
        *   Decreased in type 1 and type 3 vWD
        *   May be normal in type 2 vWD
    *   von Willebrand Factor Activity (vWF:RCo):
        *   Measures the ability of vWF to bind to platelets using ristocetin as a cofactor
        *   Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA)
        *   Decreased in most types of vWD (except for type 2B, where it is increased)
    *   Factor VIII Activity (FVIII:C):
        *   Measures the activity of factor VIII
        *   May be decreased in vWD, especially in type 2N and type 3
    *   vWF Multimer Analysis:
        *   Evaluates the distribution of vWF multimers
        *   Decreased high molecular weight multimers in type 2A vWD
    *   Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100):
        *   Measures platelet function under high shear stress
        *   Prolonged closure time in most types of vWD

*   **Diagnostic Approach:**

    1.  Perform Initial Screening Tests (CBC, PT, aPTT)
    2.  Measure vWF:Ag and vWF:RCo:
        *   If both are decreased -> Consider type 1 or type 3 vWD
        *   If vWF:Ag is normal but vWF:RCo is decreased -> Consider type 2 vWD
    3.  Perform FVIII:C Assay:
        *   If FVIII:C is decreased -> Consider type 2N vWD
    4.  Perform vWF Multimer Analysis:
        *   To differentiate type 2A from other subtypes
    5.  Perform RIPA at low concentrations of ristocetin:
        *   To identify type 2B vWD (RIPA is enhanced)
    6.  Genetic Testing: May be considered in some cases to confirm the diagnosis or classify the subtype of vWD

## **Treatment** {-}

*   **Desmopressin (DDAVP):**

    *   A synthetic analog of vasopressin that stimulates the release of vWF and factor VIII from endothelial cells
    *   Effective in treating type 1 vWD and some subtypes of type 2 vWD
    *   Administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or intranasally
    *   Side effects: Flushing, headache, hyponatremia (low sodium)
*   **vWF/Factor VIII Concentrates:**

    *   Plasma-derived concentrates that contain both vWF and factor VIII
    *   Used to treat bleeding episodes or for prophylaxis in patients with severe vWD or those who do not respond to DDAVP
    *   Examples: Humate-P, Alphanate SDH, Wilate
*   **Antifibrinolytic Agents:**

    *   Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid
    *   Inhibit fibrinolysis (the breakdown of blood clots)
    *   Used to prevent or treat bleeding, especially mucosal bleeding (e.g., menorrhagia, dental procedures)
*   **Topical Hemostatic Agents:**

    *   Thrombin-soaked gauze or fibrin sealants
    *   Used to control local bleeding
*   **Other Considerations:**

    *   Avoid Aspirin and NSAIDs: These medications can impair platelet function and increase the risk of bleeding
    *   Hormonal Therapy: Oral contraceptives or other hormonal treatments may be used to manage menorrhagia

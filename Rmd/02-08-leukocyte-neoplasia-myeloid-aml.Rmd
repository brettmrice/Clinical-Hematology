## **Overview of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of aggressive hematologic malignancies characterized by the rapid proliferation and accumulation of *myeloblasts* (immature myeloid cells) in the bone marrow and peripheral blood
*   **Hallmark:** >20% blasts in the bone marrow
*   **Classification:**
    *   The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is the most widely used system and is based on:
        *   Morphology
        *   Immunophenotype
        *   Genetic abnormalities (cytogenetics and molecular genetics)
        *   Clinical features
    *   Key Categories (According to WHO):
        *   AML with Recurrent Genetic Abnormalities
        *   AML with Myelodysplasia-Related Changes
        *   Therapy-Related AML (t-AML)
        *   AML Not Otherwise Specified (AML-NOS)
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Genetic mutations disrupt normal myeloid differentiation, leading to a buildup of myeloblasts
    *   Myeloblasts crowd out normal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, causing cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
*   **Clinical Significance:** Rapidly progressive and life-threatening if untreated

## **Etiology and Risk Factors** {-}

*   **Genetic Mutations:**
    *   AML is typically caused by acquired genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells or early myeloid progenitors
    *   These mutations can affect:
        *   Transcription factors (e.g., RUNX1, CEBPA)
        *   Signal transduction pathways (e.g., FLT3, RAS)
        *   Epigenetic modifiers (e.g., DNMT3A, TET2)
        *   Spliceosome components (e.g., SF3B1)
*   **Prior Chemotherapy or Radiation Therapy:**
    *   Therapy-related AML (t-AML) is a secondary leukemia that develops after exposure to cytotoxic agents or radiation
    *   t-AML often has poor prognosis
*   **Underlying Hematologic Disorders:**
    *   Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can transform into AML
    *   Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) can transform into AML
*   **Genetic Predisposition:**
    *   Certain inherited genetic syndromes increase the risk of developing AML (e.g., Fanconi anemia, Down syndrome)
*   **Environmental Factors:**
    *   Exposure to benzene or other chemicals
    *   Smoking

    *   Peripheral Blood Smear: Presence of blasts
    *   Immunophenotyping: Identifies the lineage and subtype of AML
    *   Cytogenetic Analysis: Detects chromosomal abnormalities
    *   Molecular Testing: Detects gene mutations

## **Treatment** {-}

*   **Goals of Treatment:**
    *   Achieve complete remission (CR): Eradication of blasts from the bone marrow and restoration of normal hematopoiesis
    *   Prevent relapse
    *   Prolong survival
*   **Phases of Treatment:**
    *   Induction Chemotherapy:
        *   Intensive chemotherapy to rapidly reduce the number of leukemic cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood
        *   Common regimens:
            *   "7+3" (cytarabine for 7 days and daunorubicin or idarubicin for 3 days)
        *   Patients are at high risk for complications (e.g., infection, bleeding) during induction
    *   Consolidation Therapy:
        *   Administered after achieving remission to eliminate any remaining leukemic cells and prevent relapse
        *   Options:
            *   Chemotherapy
            *   Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):
                *   Allogeneic HSCT (from a matched donor) is the preferred consolidation therapy for many patients with high-risk AML
*   **Treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL):**
    *   All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide (ATO) is the preferred treatment for most patients with APL
    *   This combination therapy targets the PML-RARA fusion protein and promotes differentiation of promyelocytes
    *   Chemotherapy may be added in high-risk cases
*   **Supportive Care:**

    *   Transfusions (RBCs and platelets) to manage anemia and thrombocytopenia
    *   Antibiotics and antifungals to treat infections
    *   Growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) to stimulate neutrophil production
    *   Management of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): A metabolic complication caused by the rapid breakdown of leukemic cells

## **Prognosis** {-}

*   **Factors Influencing Prognosis:**

    *   Cytogenetic Abnormalities: Certain chromosomal abnormalities are associated with favorable or unfavorable outcomes
    *   Gene Mutations: The presence of certain gene mutations (e.g., FLT3-ITD) is associated with poorer prognosis, while others (e.g., NPM1) are associated with more favorable outcomes
    *   Age: Younger patients generally have better outcomes than older patients
    *   Performance Status: Overall health and fitness of the patient
    *   Response to Induction Chemotherapy: Achievement of complete remission is a key prognostic factor
*   **Risk Stratification:**

    *   Patients are classified into risk groups (favorable, intermediate, or adverse) based on cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities
    *   Risk stratification guides treatment decisions and helps predict the likelihood of achieving long-term remission

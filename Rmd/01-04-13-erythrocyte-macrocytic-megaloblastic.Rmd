## **Overview of Megaloblastic Anemias** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of macrocytic anemias characterized by impaired DNA synthesis, resulting in abnormal maturation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and distinctive morphological changes in red blood cells
*   **Hallmark:** The presence of *megaloblasts* (large, abnormal erythroid precursors) in the bone marrow and *macrocytes* (large red blood cells) in the peripheral blood. *Hypersegmented neutrophils* (neutrophils with 5 or more lobes) are also a characteristic finding
*   **Cause:** Primarily caused by deficiencies of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) or folate (folic acid), which are essential for DNA synthesis
*   **Key Feature:** Ineffective erythropoiesis (premature destruction of abnormal RBC precursors in the bone marrow)

## **Etiology** {-}

*   **Vitamin B12 Deficiency:**
    *   **Pernicious Anemia:** Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells in the stomach, leading to decreased production of intrinsic factor (IF). IF is required for vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum.
    *   **Malabsorption Syndromes:**
        *   Gastrectomy: Removal of the stomach, leading to decreased IF production
        *   Ileal Resection or Disease (e.g., Crohn's disease): Impairs vitamin B12 absorption
        *   Bacterial Overgrowth in the Small Intestine: Bacteria compete with the host for vitamin B12
        *   Pancreatic Insufficiency: Decreased release of pancreatic proteases needed to release vitamin B12 from binding proteins
    *   **Dietary Deficiency:**
        *   Rare, but can occur in strict vegetarians (vegans) who do not supplement with vitamin B12
    *   **Other Causes:**
        *   Fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium latum) infection: The tapeworm absorbs vitamin B12 in the intestine
        *   Certain Medications (e.g., metformin, proton pump inhibitors)

*   **Folate Deficiency:**
    *   **Inadequate Dietary Intake:**
        *   Most common cause of folate deficiency
        *   Occurs in individuals with poor diets, alcoholism, or fad diets
    *   **Increased Folate Requirements:**
        *   Pregnancy: Folate requirements increase to support fetal development
        *   Hemolytic Anemia: Increased erythropoiesis increases folate demand
        *   Malignancies: Rapidly dividing cells require more folate
    *   **Malabsorption:**
        *   Celiac disease
        *   Inflammatory bowel disease
    *   **Medications:**
        *   Methotrexate: Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme required for folate metabolism
        *   Trimethoprim: Also inhibits DHFR
        *   Phenytoin: Can interfere with folate absorption
    *   **Alcohol Abuse:**
        *   Impairs folate absorption and utilization

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

*   **Impaired DNA Synthesis:**
    *   Vitamin B12 and folate are essential for the synthesis of thymidine, a nucleotide required for DNA synthesis
    *   Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor for methionine synthase, which converts homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is needed for the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF), the active form of folate
    *   Folate, in the form of tetrahydrofolate (THF), is required for several steps in DNA synthesis, including the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP)
    *   Deficiency of either vitamin B12 or folate leads to impaired DNA synthesis
*   **Megaloblastic Changes:**
    *   Impaired DNA synthesis affects rapidly dividing cells, particularly hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow
    *   Megaloblasts: Abnormal, large erythroid precursors with delayed nuclear maturation and asynchronous development of the nucleus and cytoplasm
        *   Nuclear maturation is delayed due to impaired DNA synthesis
        *   Cytoplasmic maturation proceeds normally (RNA and protein synthesis are not affected), resulting in a large cell with a relatively immature nucleus
    *   Dysplasia: Megaloblastic changes also occur in myeloid and megakaryocytic cell lines, leading to abnormal granulocytes (e.g., hypersegmented neutrophils) and platelets
*   **Ineffective Hematopoiesis:**
    *   Megaloblastic changes and DNA damage lead to increased apoptosis (programmed cell death) of hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow
    *   Results in decreased production of mature RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, leading to cytopenias
*   **Neurological Manifestations (Vitamin B12 Deficiency):**
    *   Vitamin B12 is required for the maintenance of myelin, the protective sheath around nerve fibers
    *   B12 deficiency can cause demyelination of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, leading to neurological symptoms

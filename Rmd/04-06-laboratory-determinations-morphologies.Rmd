        *   Nucleus: Round, more condensed chromatin
        *   Cytoplasm: Gray-blue (polychromatic) due to the presence of both hemoglobin and ribosomes
        *   Distinguishing Features:
            *   Gray-blue cytoplasm
            *   More condensed chromatin
    *   **Orthochromic Normoblast:**
        *   Description: The final nucleated stage of erythroid maturation
        *   Size: 8-10 μm
        *   Nucleus: Small, dense, pyknotic (about to be extruded)
        *   Cytoplasm: Pink (due to predominant hemoglobin)
        *   Distinguishing Features:
            *   Small, dense nucleus
            *   Mostly pink cytoplasm
    *   **Reticulocyte:**
        *   Anucleated red blood cell with residual RNA, not found in the bone marrow

*   **Key Considerations**

    *   **Mast Cells:** Although present in the bone marrow, mast cells are technically tissue cells and not part of the hematopoietic lineages. They are granulated cells important in allergic responses.
    *   **Plasma Cells:** Although derived from lymphocytes, plasma cells can also reside in the bone marrow. They have distinct eccentric nuclei and deeply basophilic cytoplasm.

## **Body Fluids** {-}

*   **Neutrophils:**

    *   Morphology: Similar to neutrophils in peripheral blood (segmented nucleus, pink-lilac granules)
    *   Significance: Increased numbers often indicate bacterial infection or inflammation
        *   Degenerated Neutrophils: In older fluids, neutrophils may appear pyknotic (shrunken, dark nucleus) or may be lysed

*   **Lymphocytes:**

    *   Morphology: Similar to lymphocytes in peripheral blood (round nucleus, scant cytoplasm)
    *   Significance: Increased numbers may suggest viral infection, tuberculosis, fungal infection, or chronic inflammation
    *   Reactive Lymphocytes: (Atypical lymphocytes)
        *   More abundant cytoplasm
        *   Basophilic cytoplasm
        *   May have nucleoli

*   **Monocytes/Macrophages:**

    *   Morphology: Large cells with a kidney bean-shaped or horseshoe-shaped nucleus, abundant gray-blue cytoplasm, and vacuoles
    *   Significance: Found in various inflammatory conditions and infections; can also indicate hemorrhage (erythrophagocytosis)
    *   Distinguishing Features: Cytoplasmic vacuoles and/or phagocytized material can be diagnostic of specific processes

*   **Eosinophils:**

    *   Morphology: Similar to eosinophils in peripheral blood (bilobed nucleus, large, orange-red granules)
    *   Significance: Often associated with parasitic infections, allergic reactions, or hypersensitivity reactions

*   **Basophils:**

    *   Morphology: Similar to basophils in peripheral blood (irregular, lobulated nucleus obscured by dark blue/purple granules)
    *   Significance: Less common than other cell types; may be seen in allergic reactions or certain malignancies

*   **Mesothelial Cells (Serous Fluids - Pleural, Peritoneal, Pericardial):**

    *   Morphology:

        *   Eccentric nucleus (off-center)
        *   Abundant cytoplasm (often blue-gray or pink)
        *   May have a "skirt" or "ruffled border"
        *   May be multinucleated
    *   Significance: Normal lining cells of the serous membranes
        *   Increased numbers can indicate inflammation or irritation of the serous membranes
    *   Reactive Mesothelial Cells: May have more prominent nucleoli, increased cytoplasm, and mitotic figures

*   **Synovial Lining Cells (Synovial Fluid):**

    *   Morphology:
        *   Round to oval cells
        *   Eccentric nucleus
        *   Moderate amount of cytoplasm
    *   Significance: Normal cells found in synovial fluid
        *   Increased numbers may indicate inflammation or joint damage

*   **Additional Cells (Less Common)**

*   **Blast Cells:**

    *   Morphology:
        *   Large cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio

        *   Prominent nucleoli
        *   May have scant cytoplasm
    *   Significance: Suggestive of leukemia or lymphoma with involvement of the body fluid
    *   Classification: Requires flow cytometry and other specialized tests to determine lineage (myeloid vs. lymphoid)

*   **Malignant Cells (Non-Hematologic):**

    *   Morphology:
        *   Highly variable, depending on the type of cancer
        *   May have abnormal nuclear features (e.g., irregular shape, coarse chromatin, prominent nucleoli)
        *   May have abundant cytoplasm with vacuoles or other inclusions
    *   Significance: Indicates metastatic cancer in the body fluid
    *   Origin: Usually represent metastatic carcinoma from a solid tumor

        *   Phagocytes that contain pigment granules of broken-down red blood cells with hemosiderin (iron storage complex).
    *   Significance: Indicate prior hemorrhage (bleeding) into the body fluid

*   **Lipophages (Fat-Laden Macrophages, Gitter Cells):**

    *   Morphology:
        *   Macrophages with numerous vacuoles containing lipids

# PT/INR {-}

## **Overview of the PT/INR Test** {-}

*   **Prothrombin Time (PT):**
    *   **Definition:** A coagulation test that measures the time (in seconds) it takes for plasma to clot after the addition of thromboplastin and calcium
    *   **Purpose:**
        *   Evaluate the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation
        *   Monitor oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin (Coumadin)
        *   Assess liver function
        *   Evaluate for coagulation factor deficiencies
    *   **Principle:**
        *   Thromboplastin (Tissue Factor): A reagent that contains tissue factor, phospholipids, and calcium
        *   Addition of Thromboplastin: Activates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, leading to thrombin formation and fibrin clot formation
        *   Clot Detection: The time to clot formation is measured, either manually or using an automated coagulation analyzer
*   **International Normalized Ratio (INR):**
    *   **Definition:** A standardized ratio calculated from the patient's PT result that is used to monitor warfarin therapy
    *   **Purpose:**
        *   To reduce inter-laboratory variability in PT results due to differences in thromboplastin reagents
        *   To provide a consistent and reliable measure of the degree of anticoagulation
    *   **Calculation:**
        *   INR = (Patient PT / Mean Normal PT)^ISI
        *   Patient PT: The patient's prothrombin time in seconds
        *   Mean Normal PT (MNPT): The average PT value from a group of healthy individuals tested in the same laboratory using the same thromboplastin reagent
        *   International Sensitivity Index (ISI): A value assigned to each thromboplastin reagent by the manufacturer, reflecting its sensitivity to vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors

## **Components of the PT/INR Test** {-}

*   **Specimen Collection:**
    *   Collection Tube: Sodium citrate (light blue top) tube with a 3.2% or 3.8% sodium citrate concentration
    *   Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: The correct ratio is critical for accurate results:
        *   9:1 ratio of blood to anticoagulant
        *   Underfilling the tube can lead to falsely prolonged PT/INR results
        *   Overfilling the tube can lead to falsely shortened PT/INR results

*   **Reagents:**

    *   Thromboplastin: Contains tissue factor, phospholipids, and calcium ions, which initiate the extrinsic pathway of coagulation
    *   Calcium Chloride: Provides calcium ions, which are essential for the activity of coagulation factors
    *   Standard: Used to create a clot based on a known sample.

*   **Instrumentation:**

    *   Automated Coagulation Analyzer: Detects clot formation using optical or mechanical methods:
        *   Optical Method: Measures changes in light transmission as the clot forms
        *   Mechanical Method: Detects the movement of a probe or wire as the clot forms

## **Procedure for Performing the PT/INR Test** {-}

1.  Sample Preparation:
    *   Centrifuge the sodium citrate tube to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP)
    *   PPP should have a platelet count < 10 x 10^9/L

2.  Automated Method:
    *   Follow the instrument manufacturer's instructions
    *   Add thromboplastin reagent to the plasma
    *   Add calcium chloride to initiate coagulation
    *   Measure the time to clot formation (PT in seconds)

3.  INR Calculation:
    *   The instrument automatically calculates the INR using the formula:
        INR = (Patient PT / Mean Normal PT)^ISI
        
4.  Quality Control:
    *   Run control materials at regular intervals to assess the accuracy and precision of the test
    *   Review control results and take corrective action if necessary

## **Interpreting Results** {-}

*   **Prothrombin Time (PT):**

    *   Reference Range: Varies depending on the thromboplastin reagent and instrument used (e.g. 11-13 seconds)
    *   Prolonged PT: Indicates a deficiency or dysfunction of one or more factors in the extrinsic or common pathways (Factors II, V, VII, X, or fibrinogen)
        *   Liver Disease: Impaired synthesis of coagulation factors
        *   Vitamin K Deficiency: Impaired carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent factors
        *   Warfarin Therapy: Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent factors
        *   Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): Consumption of coagulation factors
        *   Factor VII Deficiency: Specific deficiency of Factor VII
        
*   **International Normalized Ratio (INR):**

    *   Target INR Range for Warfarin Therapy:
        *   Typically 2.0-3.0 for most indications (e.g., atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism)
        *   Higher INR ranges (e.g., 2.5-3.5) may be used for patients with mechanical heart valves
    *   INR < Target Range: Indicates subtherapeutic anticoagulation and increased risk of thrombosis
    *   INR > Target Range: Indicates supratherapeutic anticoagulation and increased risk of bleeding

## **Factors Affecting PT/INR Results** {-}

*   **Pre-Analytical Variables:**
    *   Improper Collection Technique: Tissue thromboplastin contamination or hemolysis
    *   Incorrect Blood-to-Anticoagulant Ratio: Underfilling or overfilling the collection tube
    *   Clotted Sample: Invalidates the results
    *   Delayed Testing: Coagulation factors can degrade over time
    *   Improper Storage: Incorrect storage temperatures can affect results
*   **Analytical Variables:**
    *   Instrument Malfunction: Ensure proper calibration and maintenance of the coagulation analyzer
    *   Reagent Problems: Use fresh, properly stored reagents and follow the manufacturer's instructions
    *   Lipemia or Icterus: Can interfere with optical clot detection
    *   High Factor V Level: Can artificially shorten the PT
*   **Patient-Related Variables:**
    *   Medications: Warfarin, heparin, direct oral anticoagulants, and other medications can affect coagulation test results
    *   Diet: Vitamin K intake can affect warfarin therapy
    *   Liver Disease: Impairs the synthesis of coagulation factors
    *   Genetic Factors: Rare genetic variations can affect coagulation factor levels

## **Troubleshooting Erroneous Results** {-}

*   If the PT/INR result is inconsistent with the patient's clinical presentation or previous results:
    *   Check the sample for clots or hemolysis
    *   Repeat the test on a fresh sample
    *   Ensure that the correct blood-to-anticoagulant ratio was used
    *   Verify the instrument and reagent quality control results
    *   Investigate potential interfering substances (e.g., lipemia)
    *   Review the patient's medication list and medical history
    *   Perform a mixing study to rule out factor inhibitors

## **Overview of Qualitative Hemoglobin Analysis** {-}

*   **Definition:** Laboratory tests used to identify and characterize different types of hemoglobin in a blood sample. These tests are crucial for diagnosing hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Detect and quantify normal and abnormal hemoglobin variants (e.g., HbA, HbA2, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE)
    *   Identify hemoglobinopathies in patients with anemia, jaundice, or a family history of hemoglobin disorders
    *   Screen newborns for sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies
    *   Monitor treatment response in patients with hemoglobinopathies
*   **Methods:**
    *   Hemoglobin Electrophoresis
    *   High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
    *   Sickle Solubility Testing

## **Hemoglobin Electrophoresis** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Separates hemoglobin variants based on their electrical charge and migration patterns in an electric field
    *   Hemoglobin molecules are placed on a supporting medium (e.g., cellulose acetate or agarose gel) and an electric current is applied
    *   Different hemoglobin types migrate at different rates depending on their charge
    *   After electrophoresis, the separated hemoglobin bands are visualized using a stain

## **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)** {-}

*   **Principle:**
        *   Separates hemoglobin variants based on their interaction with a stationary phase in a column, followed by detection using spectrophotometry
    *   Steps:
        *   The hemolysate is injected into a column packed with a solid material (stationary phase)
        *   A liquid solvent (mobile phase) is pumped through the column
        *   Hemoglobin variants interact differently with the stationary phase based on their size, charge, and hydrophobicity
        *   As each hemoglobin variant elutes from the column, it passes through a detector (spectrophotometer) that measures its absorbance at a specific wavelength
        *   The detector generates a chromatogram, which shows a series of peaks corresponding to the different hemoglobin types

## **Sickle Solubility Testing** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Hemoglobin S (HbS) is insoluble in a concentrated phosphate buffer when deoxygenated, causing the solution to become turbid (cloudy)
    *   Other hemoglobins remain soluble in the buffer

## **Quality Control** {-}

*   **Run Controls with Known Hemoglobin Patterns:**
    *   Include normal and abnormal controls with each electrophoresis or HPLC run
    *   The control results should fall within established reference ranges
*   **Document All Quality Control Procedures:**
    *   Record the dates, lot numbers, and results of all quality control procedures
*   **Follow Established Laboratory Procedures:**
    *   Adhere to standardized operating procedures for performing and interpreting hemoglobin analysis
*   **Participate in Proficiency Testing Programs:**
    *   To assess the accuracy and reliability of the laboratory's testing

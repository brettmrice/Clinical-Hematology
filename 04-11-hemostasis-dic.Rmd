# DIC {-}

## **Overview of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** {-}

*   **Definition:** A complex and life-threatening acquired syndrome characterized by widespread activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, leading to consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, and ultimately resulting in both thrombosis and bleeding
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Systemic Activation of Coagulation: Uncontrolled activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of microthrombi throughout the vasculature
    *   Consumption of Coagulation Factors and Platelets: Widespread clotting consumes coagulation factors and platelets, leading to deficiencies
    *   Activation of Fibrinolysis: Activation of the fibrinolytic system to break down the microthrombi, resulting in the generation of fibrin degradation products (FDPs)
    *   Bleeding and Thrombosis: The consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, combined with excessive fibrinolysis, leads to both bleeding and thrombotic complications
*   **Always Secondary:** DIC is *never* a primary disease; it is always secondary to an underlying disorder
*   **High Mortality Rate:** DIC is associated with significant morbidity and mortality

## **Etiology and Triggering Events** {-}

*   **Sepsis:**

    *   Severe bacterial, fungal, or viral infections
    *   Gram-negative bacteria are a common cause of DIC

*   **Trauma:**

    *   Severe tissue injury, burns, or crush injuries
    *   Release of tissue factor into the circulation

*   **Obstetric Complications:**

    *   Abruptio placentae (premature separation of the placenta)
    *   Amniotic fluid embolism
    *   Preeclampsia and eclampsia
    *   Septic abortion

*   **Malignancy:**

    *   Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL): A specific subtype of AML associated with a high risk of DIC due to the release of procoagulant substances from leukemic cells
    *   Solid tumors (e.g., lung, breast, ovarian, prostate): Can release tissue factor or other procoagulant substances

*   **Other Causes:**

    *   Severe allergic or toxic reactions
    *   Transfusion reactions
    *   Snake bites
    *   Pancreatitis
    *   Liver disease
    *   Aortic aneurysm

## **Pathophysiology** {-}

The pathophysiology of DIC involves a complex interplay between the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems:

*   **Triggering Event:** The underlying disorder releases procoagulant substances into the circulation (e.g., tissue factor, inflammatory cytokines)
*   **Activation of Coagulation:** The extrinsic pathway of coagulation is activated by the release of tissue factor, leading to:

    *   Formation of Thrombin: Activation of the coagulation cascade leads to increased thrombin generation
    *   Fibrin Formation: Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, resulting in the formation of microthrombi throughout the vasculature
*   **Consumption of Coagulation Factors and Platelets:**

    *   Widespread clotting consumes coagulation factors (Factors V, VIII, fibrinogen) and platelets, leading to deficiencies
*   **Activation of Fibrinolysis:**

    *   Thrombin also activates the fibrinolytic system by releasing tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) from endothelial cells
    *   Plasminogen is converted to plasmin, which degrades fibrin clots into fibrin degradation products (FDPs), including D-dimer
*   **Bleeding and Thrombosis:** The consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, combined with excessive fibrinolysis, leads to:

    *   Microthrombi: Can cause organ ischemia and damage, leading to kidney failure, respiratory distress, and neurological dysfunction
    *   Bleeding: Due to the deficiency of coagulation factors and platelets

## **Clinical Features** {-}

*   **Bleeding:**
    *   Oozing from IV sites, surgical wounds, and mucous membranes
    *   Petechiae (small, pinpoint hemorrhages)
    *   Purpura (larger areas of bleeding under the skin)
    *   Gastrointestinal bleeding
    *   Pulmonary hemorrhage
    *   Intracranial hemorrhage
*   **Thrombosis:**
    *   Microthrombi can cause organ damage and dysfunction
    *   Kidney failure (oliguria, anuria)
    *   Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
    *   Neurological dysfunction (altered mental status, seizures, coma)
    *   Skin necrosis
    *   Limb ischemia
*   **Other Symptoms:**
    *   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
    *   Tachycardia (increased heart rate)
    *   Fever

## **Laboratory Findings** {-}

*   **Coagulation Studies:**

    *   Prothrombin Time (PT): Prolonged
    *   Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): Prolonged
    *   Thrombin Time (TT): Prolonged
    *   Reptilase Time: Prolonged (may be normal in some cases)
    *   Mixing Studies: PT and aPTT typically do not correct on mixing with normal plasma

*   **Fibrinogen Level:**

    *   Decreased (often <100 mg/dL)
    *   Reflects consumption of fibrinogen

*   **Platelet Count:**

    *   Decreased (thrombocytopenia) - often <100 x 10^9/L
    *   Platelet count decreases as the patient's condition worsen

*   **Fibrin Degradation Products (FDPs):**

    *   Elevated
    *   Latex agglutination assay is positive

*   **D-dimer:**

    *   Markedly Elevated
    *   D-dimer is a cross-linked fibrin degradation product and is a more specific marker for DIC than FDPs

*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**

    *   Schistocytes (fragmented RBCs): Indicate microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)
    *   Thrombocytopenia

*   **Other Tests:**

    *   Antithrombin Level: Decreased
    *   Protein C and S Levels: Decreased
    *   Factor Assays: Decreased levels of Factors V and VIII
    *   Reptilase Time: Reptilase time measures fibrin formation independent of thrombin so is used to evaluate fibrinogen function
        *   Prolonged in the setting of dysfibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia

## **Diagnostic Scoring Systems** {-}

*   Several scoring systems have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of DIC
*   The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) scoring system is one of the most widely used
*   Scoring systems consider:
    *   Platelet count
    *   Prothrombin time (PT)
    *   Fibrinogen level
    *   D-dimer level

## **Treatment** {-}

*   **Treat the Underlying Cause:** This is the *most important* step in managing DIC.
    *   Antibiotics for sepsis
    *   Surgical evacuation of retained products of conception in obstetric DIC
    *   Chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
*   **Supportive Care:**

    *   Transfusions:
        *   Platelet transfusions to maintain platelet count > 20-30 x 10^9/L (or higher if there is active bleeding)
        *   Packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain adequate oxygen delivery
        *   Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP): To provide coagulation factors
        *   Cryoprecipitate: To increase fibrinogen levels (target fibrinogen > 100 mg/dL)
*   **Anticoagulation:**

    *   Heparin: May be considered in *specific* situations (e.g., APL-associated DIC or thrombosis-dominant DIC) to inhibit thrombin generation
        *   Use is controversial and requires careful monitoring due to the risk of worsening bleeding
        *   Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) may be preferred over unfractionated heparin
*   **Antifibrinolytic Therapy:**

    *   Controversial and generally *not recommended*
    *   May be considered in *rare* situations with life-threatening bleeding and evidence of primary fibrinolysis (very low fibrinogen and elevated D-dimer)

## **Prognosis** {-}

*   **Poor Prognosis:** DIC is associated with a high mortality rate
*   **Factors Influencing Prognosis:**
    *   Severity of the underlying condition
    *   Rapid and effective treatment of the underlying cause
    *   Prompt recognition and management of DIC complications

## **Key Laboratory Tests for DIC** {-}

*   **PT, aPTT, TT:** Prolonged
*   **Platelet Count:** Decreased
*   **Fibrinogen Level:** Decreased
*   **D-dimer:** Markedly Elevated
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:** Schistocytes

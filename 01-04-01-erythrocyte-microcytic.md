# Microcytic {-}

## **Overview of Microcytic Anemias** {-}

*   **Definition:** A type of anemia characterized by red blood cells (RBCs) that are smaller than normal
*   **Key Indicator:** Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is less than 80 femtoliters (fL)
*   **Underlying Cause:** Typically results from impaired hemoglobin synthesis
*   **Common Causes (Think "TICS"):**
    *   **T**halassemia
    *   **I**ron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)
    *   Anemia of **C**hronic Disease/Inflammation
    *   **S**ideroblastic Anemia

## **General Laboratory Findings in Microcytic Anemias** {-}

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
    *   Hemoglobin (HGB): Decreased (anemia)
    *   Hematocrit (HCT): Decreased
    *   Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): Decreased (< 80 fL)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): Decreased (hypochromia)
    *   Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): Decreased (hypochromia)
    *   Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW): Often increased, but may be normal in some cases (e.g., thalassemia trait)
*   **Peripheral Blood Smear:**
    *   Microcytes (small RBCs)
    *   Hypochromia (pale RBCs)
    *   Anisocytosis (variation in RBC size)
    *   Poikilocytosis (variation in RBC shape) - varies depending on the specific cause

## **Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Anemia caused by inadequate iron stores, leading to decreased hemoglobin production
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Inadequate iron intake (dietary deficiency)
    *   Increased iron loss (bleeding)
    *   Impaired iron absorption
    *   Increased iron requirements (e.g., pregnancy)
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Iron is essential for heme synthesis
    *   Insufficient iron leads to decreased hemoglobin production, resulting in smaller and paler red blood cells
*   **Clinical Manifestations:**
    *   General anemia symptoms: Fatigue, weakness, pallor
    *   Specific IDA symptoms:
        *   Pica (unusual cravings for non-food substances)
        *   Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails)
        *   Angular cheilitis (inflammation at the corners of the mouth)
        *   Glossitis (inflammation of the tongue)
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Microcytic, hypochromic anemia
        *   Increased RDW
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Microcytes
        *   Hypochromia
        *   Pencil cells (elongated, thin RBCs)
        *   Target cells (less common than in thalassemia)
    *   Reticulocyte Count:
        *   Low or normal (inappropriately low for the degree of anemia)
    *   Iron Studies:
        *   Serum Iron: Decreased
        *   Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC): Increased
        *   Transferrin Saturation: Decreased
        *   Ferritin: Decreased (most specific indicator of iron deficiency)
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Identify and treat the underlying cause of iron loss (e.g., bleeding)
    *   Oral iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate)
    *   Parenteral iron (IV iron) for patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron
    *   Dietary advice to increase iron intake

## **Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Anemia associated with chronic inflammatory, infectious, or malignant conditions
*   **Etiology:**
    *   Chronic inflammatory diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
    *   Chronic infections: Tuberculosis (TB), HIV
    *   Malignancies: Cancer, lymphoma
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6) stimulate the production of hepcidin by the liver
    *   Hepcidin inhibits iron release from macrophages and enterocytes by binding to ferroportin, leading to iron trapping
    *   EPO production may be suppressed
*   **Clinical Manifestations:**
    *   Often masked by the symptoms of the underlying chronic disease
    *   Mild to moderate anemia symptoms: Fatigue, weakness
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Usually normocytic and normochromic, but can be microcytic in some cases
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Usually normocytic and normochromic, but may show microcytes and hypochromia in some cases
    *   Reticulocyte Count:
        *   Low or normal (inappropriately low for the degree of anemia)
    *   Iron Studies:
        *   Serum Iron: Decreased
        *   Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC): Normal or decreased
        *   Transferrin Saturation: Normal or decreased
        *   Ferritin: Normal or increased (key differentiating factor from IDA)
    *   Markers of Inflammation:
        *   Elevated ESR and CRP
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Treat the underlying chronic condition
    *   Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in selected patients (e.g., CKD)
    *   Iron supplementation (IV iron) if iron deficiency is present or for patients on ESAs
    *   Blood transfusions for severe anemia

## **Thalassemia** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of inherited blood disorders characterized by decreased or absent synthesis of one or more globin chains (alpha or beta) that make up hemoglobin
*   **Genetic Basis:** Mutations in the alpha- or beta-globin genes
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Reduced globin chain synthesis leads to:
        *   Decreased hemoglobin production, resulting in microcytic, hypochromic anemia
        *   Imbalance in globin chain ratios, leading to precipitation of excess globin chains within RBC precursors, causing cellular damage and premature destruction (ineffective erythropoiesis)
*   **Classification:**
    *   Alpha (α) Thalassemia: Decreased or absent synthesis of alpha-globin chains
    *   Beta (β) Thalassemia: Decreased or absent synthesis of beta-globin chains
*   **Clinical Features:** Varies widely depending on the specific genetic defect and the number of affected genes
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   Microcytic, hypochromic anemia
        *   RBC count may be normal or elevated relative to the degree of anemia
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Microcytes
        *   Hypochromia
        *   Target cells
        *   Basophilic stippling
        *   Nucleated RBCs (in severe cases)
    *   Reticulocyte Count:
        *   Elevated
    *   Iron Studies:
        *   Normal or elevated (not iron deficient)
    *   Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:
        *   Abnormal hemoglobin patterns (e.g., elevated HbA2 in beta-thalassemia trait, presence of HbH in alpha-thalassemia)
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Based on clinical presentation, peripheral blood smear, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and genetic testing
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Varies depending on the severity of the disease:
        *   Mild thalassemia: No treatment or folic acid supplementation
        *   Moderate thalassemia: Occasional blood transfusions
        *   Severe thalassemia (thalassemia major): Regular blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)

## **Sideroblastic Anemia** {-}

*   **Definition:** A group of disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the bone marrow
*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Impaired ability of the bone marrow to incorporate iron into hemoglobin
    *   Iron accumulates in the mitochondria of erythroblasts, forming ringed sideroblasts
*   **Classification:**
    *   Hereditary Sideroblastic Anemias
    *   Acquired Sideroblastic Anemias
        *   Reversible (e.g., alcohol-induced, drug-induced, copper deficiency)
        *   Irreversible (e.g., myelodysplastic syndromes)
*   **Clinical Features:**
    *   Anemia symptoms: Fatigue, weakness, pallor
    *   Iron overload: Can lead to liver damage, heart failure, and endocrine dysfunction
*   **Laboratory Findings:**
    *   CBC:
        *   MCV may be low, normal, or high
        *   Dimorphic red cell population (mixture of normal and abnormal RBCs)
    *   Peripheral Blood Smear:
        *   Microcytes
        *   Hypochromia
        *   Pappenheimer bodies (iron-containing inclusions in RBCs)
        *   Basophilic stippling
    *   Reticulocyte Count:
        *   Low or normal
    *   Iron Studies:
        *   Serum Iron: Increased
        *   Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC): Decreased or normal
        *   Transferrin Saturation: Increased

    *   Based on CBC, peripheral blood smear, iron studies, and bone marrow examination
*   **Treatment:**
    *   Identify and treat the underlying cause
    *   Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation (may be effective in some cases)
    *   Blood transfusions for severe anemia

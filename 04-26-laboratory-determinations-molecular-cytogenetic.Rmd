## **Overview of Molecular and Cytogenetic Testing in Hematology** {-}

*   **Definition:** Laboratory techniques used to identify genetic abnormalities (chromosomal and molecular) in blood and bone marrow cells
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Diagnosis and Classification: Essential for diagnosing and classifying hematologic malignancies, including leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms
    *   Prognosis: Many genetic abnormalities have prognostic significance and can help predict the course of the disease
    *   Therapeutic Decision-Making: Some genetic abnormalities are targets for specific therapies
    *   Monitoring Treatment Response: Used to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) and monitor treatment response
*   **Types of Tests:**
    *   Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping)
    *   Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)
    *   Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
    *   Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

## **Cytogenetic Analysis (Karyotyping)** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Analyzes the structure and number of chromosomes in a cell
    *   Cells are cultured, arrested in metaphase, and then stained to visualize the chromosomes
    *   Chromosomes are arranged in a standardized format (karyotype)
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Sample Collection: Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
    2.  Cell Culture: Cells are cultured to increase the number of cells in metaphase
    3.  Chromosome Preparation: Cells are treated with a chemical (e.g., colchicine) to arrest them in metaphase, then lysed and fixed
    4.  Staining: Chromosomes are stained with Giemsa or other banding techniques to reveal their structure
    5.  Microscopic Examination: A trained cytogeneticist examines the stained chromosomes under a microscope
    6.  Karyotype Analysis: Chromosomes are arranged in a standardized format, and any abnormalities (e.g., translocations, deletions, inversions) are identified
*   **Reporting:**
    *   Karyotype is described using the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN)
    *   Example: 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) indicates a male karyotype with a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Provides a global view of the entire genome
    *   Can detect complex chromosomal rearrangements
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Requires viable cells and cell culture
    *   Time-consuming
    *   Limited resolution (cannot detect small deletions or point mutations)
    *   Cannot detect abnormalities in non-dividing cells

## **Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)** {-}

*   **Principle:**
    *   Uses fluorescently labeled DNA probes that bind to specific DNA sequences on chromosomes
    *   Allows for the detection of specific chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., translocations, deletions, amplifications) in individual cells
*   **Procedure:**
    1.  Prepare a Cell Suspension: Bone marrow aspirate, peripheral blood, or tissue sample
    2.  Hybridization: Fluorescently labeled DNA probes are hybridized to the chromosomes on a slide
    3.  Washing: Unbound probes are washed away
    4.  Microscopic Examination: The slide is examined under a fluorescence microscope, and the number and location of the fluorescent signals are counted
*   **Types of FISH Probes:**
    *   Break-Apart Probes: Detect chromosomal translocations by flanking the breakpoint region; a normal cell will show two fusion signals, while a cell with the translocation will show separated signals
    *   Fusion Probes: Detect chromosomal translocations by hybridizing to both fusion partners; a normal cell will show separate signals, while a cell with the translocation will show a fusion signal
    *   Enumeration Probes: Detect the number of copies of a specific gene or chromosome; used to identify deletions or amplifications
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Relatively rapid turnaround time compared to karyotyping
    *   Can be performed on non-dividing cells
    *   Can detect submicroscopic deletions and translocations
*   **Limitations:**
    *   Only detects known chromosomal abnormalities for which probes are available
    *   Cannot detect novel or complex chromosomal rearrangements

## **Molecular Testing (PCR and Next-Generation Sequencing)** {-}

*   **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR):**
    *   *Principle:* Amplifies specific DNA sequences, allowing for the detection of gene mutations and fusion genes
    *   *Procedure:*
        1.  DNA Extraction: Extract DNA from bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
        2.  Amplification: Use PCR to amplify the target DNA sequence using specific primers
        3.  Detection: Detect the amplified DNA product using gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR, or other methods
    *   *Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR):*
        *   Allows for the quantification of the amplified DNA product
        *   Used for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukemia
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   High sensitivity and specificity
        *   Relatively rapid turnaround time
    *   *Limitations:*
        *   Can only detect known mutations or fusion genes for which primers are available
        *   Cannot detect novel or unknown genetic abnormalities

*   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):**
    *   *Principle:* Massively parallel sequencing technology that allows for the simultaneous sequencing of millions of DNA fragments
    *   *Procedure:*
        1.  DNA Extraction: Extract DNA from bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood
        2.  Library Preparation: Prepare a DNA library by fragmenting the DNA and adding adaptors
        3.  Sequencing: Sequence the DNA fragments using an NGS platform
        4.  Data Analysis: Align the sequencing reads to a reference genome and identify gene mutations, insertions, deletions, and other genomic alterations
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   Can detect both known and novel mutations
        *   Can detect multiple mutations simultaneously
        *   Can be used to identify gene expression changes
    *   *Limitations:*
        *   More complex and expensive than PCR-based methods
        *   Requires bioinformatics expertise for data analysis

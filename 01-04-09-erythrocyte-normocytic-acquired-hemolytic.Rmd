# Acquired Hemolytic {-}

## **Overview of Acquired [Immune-Mediated] Hemolytic Anemias**

*   **Definition:** Hemolysis (RBC destruction) that occurs due to the binding of antibodies and/or complement proteins to the surface of RBCs
*   **Hallmark:** A positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT), also known as a Coombs test. The DAT detects the presence of antibodies or complement proteins bound to RBCs
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA):** Antibodies are directed against the individual's own RBC antigens
        *   Warm AIHA
        *   Cold AIHA (Cold Agglutinin Disease)
        *   Paroxysmal Cold Hemoglobinuria (PCH)
    *   **Drug-Induced Hemolytic Anemia:** Antibodies are produced as a result of drug exposure
    *   **Alloimmune Hemolytic Anemia:** Antibodies are directed against foreign RBC antigens, typically following transfusion or during pregnancy
        *   Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN)
        *   Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions

## **Mechanisms of Immune-Mediated Hemolysis**
*   **The Players**
    *   **Red Blood Cells (RBCs):** Our innocent bystanders in this scenario, carrying antigens on their surface that can be mistakenly targeted by the immune system
    *   **Antibodies:** Immunoglobulins (IgG or IgM) produced by B lymphocytes that can bind to specific antigens on the RBC surface
    *   **Complement System:** A group of plasma proteins that, when activated, can lead to cell lysis, inflammation, and enhanced phagocytosis
    *   **Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS) / Reticuloendothelial System (RES):** A network of phagocytic cells (macrophages) located throughout the body (especially in the spleen and liver) that engulf and destroy antibody- and/or complement-coated RBCs

*   **The Process**
    1.  **Sensitization (Antibody Binding):**
        *   The process begins when antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of RBCs. These antigens can be:
            *   **Self-antigens:** In autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), the antibodies are autoantibodies that mistakenly recognize the individual's own RBC antigens as foreign
            *   **Drug-related antigens:** In drug-induced hemolytic anemia, the antibodies may be directed against a drug that has adsorbed to the RBC surface or against a drug-antibody complex
            *   **Foreign antigens:** In alloimmune hemolytic anemia, the antibodies are alloantibodies that recognize foreign RBC antigens from a previous transfusion or from the fetus during pregnancy
        *   The type of antibody involved (IgG or IgM) and the density of antigen sites on the RBC influence the subsequent steps
    
    2.  **Activation of the Complement System (Complement-Mediated Hemolysis):**
        *   This is more common with IgM antibodies, but IgG can also activate complement
        *   The classical pathway of complement activation is triggered when C1q binds to the Fc region of IgM or IgG antibodies on the RBC surface
        *   This leads to a cascade of events, resulting in the sequential activation of other complement proteins (C1, C4, C2, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9)
        *   Key Steps:
            *   **C3 Convertase Formation:** C4b2a (C3 convertase) cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b
            *   **C5 Convertase Formation:** C4b2a3b (C5 convertase) cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b
            *   **Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) Assembly:** C5b initiates the assembly of the MAC (C5b-C6-C7-C8-C9) on the RBC membrane
        *   Outcomes of Complement Activation:
            *   **Intravascular Hemolysis:** The MAC inserts into the RBC membrane, creating pores that disrupt the cell's osmotic balance, leading to lysis (rupture) within the blood vessels
            *   **Opsonization:** C3b opsonizes (coats) RBCs, making them more recognizable to phagocytes in the MPS (see below)
            *   **Anaphylatoxins:** C3a and C5a are released and act as anaphylatoxins, promoting inflammation and attracting immune cells
    
    3.  **Extravascular Hemolysis (MPS-Mediated):**
        *   Even if the complement cascade isn't fully activated to the point of forming the MAC, antibody- and/or complement-coated RBCs are targeted for destruction by the MPS, primarily in the spleen and liver
        *   The Process:
            *   **Opsonization:** RBCs are coated with IgG antibodies and/or complement fragments (primarily C3b)
            *   **Recognition by Macrophages:** Macrophages in the spleen and liver express:
                *   Fc receptors that bind to the Fc region of IgG antibodies
                *   Complement receptors (e.g., CR1) that bind to C3b
            *   **Phagocytosis:** Macrophages engulf and destroy the antibody- and/or complement-coated RBCs
        *   Consequences of Phagocytosis:
            *   **RBC Destruction:** The RBC is broken down within the macrophage
            *   **Hemoglobin Breakdown:** Hemoglobin is metabolized into:
                *   Globin: Broken down into amino acids
                *   Iron: Recycled or stored as ferritin/hemosiderin
                *   Porphyrin: Converted to bilirubin, which is released into the circulation

*   **Key Players in More Detail**
    *   **Antibodies (IgG and IgM):**
        *   **IgG:**
            *   More efficient at opsonization and promoting extravascular hemolysis
            *   Can cross the placenta and cause HDFN
            *   Warm AIHA is typically IgG-mediated
        *   **IgM:**
            *   More efficient at activating the complement cascade, leading to intravascular hemolysis
            *   Cannot cross the placenta (due to its large size)
            *   Cold AIHA is typically IgM-mediated
    *   **Complement System:**
        *   A cascade of plasma proteins that, when activated, can lead to:
            *   Cell lysis (formation of the MAC)
            *   Opsonization (coating cells to enhance phagocytosis)
            *   Inflammation (release of anaphylatoxins)
    *   **Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS) / Reticuloendothelial System (RES):**
        *   A network of phagocytic cells (primarily macrophages) that remove debris and participate in immune responses
        *   In immune-mediated hemolysis, the MPS is responsible for:
            *   Recognizing and engulfing antibody- and/or complement-coated RBCs
            *   Breaking down the RBCs and recycling their components


## **Types of Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemias**

*   **Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)**
    *   **Definition:** Anemia caused by autoantibodies directed against the individual's own RBC antigens
    *   **Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (Warm AIHA):**
        *   Antibody Type: IgG
        *   Temperature Reactivity: Reacts optimally at body temperature (37°C)
        *   Mechanism:
            *   IgG antibodies bind to RBCs
            *   RBCs are opsonized and phagocytized by macrophages in the spleen (extravascular hemolysis)
            *   Some complement activation may occur
        *   Etiology:
            *   Primary (idiopathic): No underlying cause
            *   Secondary: Associated with autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE), lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., CLL), infections, or drugs
        *   Laboratory Findings:
            *   DAT: Positive for IgG (and sometimes complement)
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear: Spherocytes, polychromasia
            *   Increased reticulocyte count
            *   Elevated bilirubin and LDH
            *   Decreased haptoglobin
    *   **Cold Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (Cold AIHA):**
        *   Antibody Type: IgM.
        *   Temperature Reactivity: Reacts optimally at low temperatures (4°C)
        *   Mechanism:
            *   IgM antibodies bind to RBCs in colder parts of the body (e.g., extremities)
            *   This activates the complement cascade, leading to:
                *   Intravascular hemolysis (formation of MAC)
                *   Opsonization of RBCs with C3b, leading to splenic sequestration (extravascular hemolysis)
            *   IgM antibodies may detach from RBCs at warmer temperatures, but complement fragments remain bound, leading to RBC destruction
        *   Etiology:
            *   Acute Cold AIHA (Cold Agglutinin Disease): Often associated with infections (e.g., *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, infectious mononucleosis). The IgM antibodies are often transient and disappear after the infection resolves
            *   Chronic Cold AIHA: Associated with lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., Waldenström macroglobulinemia)
        *   Laboratory Findings:
            *   DAT: Positive for complement (C3d) only. IgG is usually negative because IgM detaches from RBCs
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear: RBC agglutination (clumping of RBCs)
            *   Increased reticulocyte count
            *   Elevated bilirubin and LDH
            *   Decreased haptoglobin
            *   Cold Agglutinin Titer: Elevated (measures the concentration of cold-reacting IgM antibodies)
    *   **Paroxysmal Cold Hemoglobinuria (PCH):**
        *   Antibody Type: IgG antibody called the Donath-Landsteiner antibody
        *   Temperature Reactivity: Binds to RBCs at low temperatures and causes complement-mediated hemolysis upon warming
        *   Mechanism:
            *   The Donath-Landsteiner antibody binds to the P antigen on RBCs at low temperatures
            *   Upon warming to body temperature, the antibody activates the complement cascade, leading to intravascular hemolysis
        *   Etiology:
            *   Historically associated with syphilis
            *   Now more commonly associated with viral infections in children
        *   Clinical Features:
            *   Sudden onset of hemolytic anemia, often after exposure to cold
            *   Hemoglobinuria (dark urine)
            *   Fever, chills, abdominal pain
        *   Laboratory Findings:
            *   CBC: Anemia
            *   Peripheral Blood Smear: May show spherocytes, polychromasia
            *   Reticulocyte Count: Elevated
            *   Elevated bilirubin and LDH
            *   Decreased haptoglobin
            *   DAT: Positive for complement (C3d) only
            *   Donath-Landsteiner Test: Positive (confirms the presence of the Donath-Landsteiner antibody)

*   **Drug-Induced Hemolytic Anemia**
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Drug Adsorption: Drug binds to the RBC membrane, and antibodies are directed against the drug-RBC complex
        *   Immune Complex Formation: Drug binds to antibody in the plasma, and the immune complex binds to RBCs, leading to complement activation
        *   Autoantibody Formation: Drug induces the production of autoantibodies against RBCs (similar to warm AIHA)
    *   **Common Drugs:**
        *   Penicillin and cephalosporins (drug adsorption)
        *   Quinidine and quinine (immune complex formation)
        *   Methyldopa (autoantibody formation)
    *   **Laboratory Findings:**
        *   CBC: Anemia
        *   Peripheral Blood Smear: Spherocytes, polychromasia
        *   Reticulocyte Count: Elevated
        *   DAT: Positive (may be positive for IgG, complement, or both)
        *   Drug-specific antibody testing (may be available)
    *   **Treatment:** Discontinue the offending drug

*   **Alloimmune Hemolytic Anemia**
    *   **Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN):**
        *   Mechanism:
            *   Maternal alloantibodies (usually IgG) cross the placenta and attack fetal RBCs
            *   Most commonly caused by Rh incompatibility (anti-D) or ABO incompatibility
            *   Rh Incompatibility: Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood during pregnancy or delivery, leading to the production of anti-D antibodies. In subsequent pregnancies, these antibodies cross the placenta and attack Rh-positive fetal RBCs
            *   ABO Incompatibility: Mother with blood type O has anti-A and anti-B IgG antibodies that can cross the placenta and attack fetal RBCs (usually milder than Rh incompatibility)
        *   Clinical Features:
            *   Fetal anemia, hydrops fetalis (severe edema), jaundice after birth
        *   Laboratory Findings:
            *   Maternal Antibody Screening: Detects the presence of alloantibodies in the mother's serum
            *   DAT on Newborn RBCs: Positive for IgG (and sometimes complement)
            *   Bilirubin: Elevated in the newborn
        *   Prevention:
            *   RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin) is administered to Rh-negative mothers during pregnancy and after delivery to prevent Rh sensitization
        *   Treatment:
            *   Intrauterine transfusions for severe fetal anemia
            *   Exchange transfusions after birth to reduce bilirubin levels
    *   **Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions:**
        *   Mechanism:
            *   Recipient produces alloantibodies against donor RBC antigens (e.g., anti-A, anti-B, anti-Rh antibodies)
            *   Transfused RBCs are attacked by recipient antibodies, leading to hemolysis
        *   Types:
            *   Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction: Occurs within minutes to hours after transfusion. Symptoms include fever, chills, chest pain, back pain, and hemoglobinuria
            *   Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction: Occurs days to weeks after transfusion. Symptoms may be milder
        *   Laboratory Findings:
            *   DAT: Positive on post-transfusion RBCs
            *   Antibody Identification: Detects alloantibodies in the patient's serum
            *   Elevated bilirubin and LDH
            *   Decreased haptoglobin
        *   Treatment:
            *   Stop the transfusion immediately
            *   Supportive care (IV fluids, vasopressors)
            *   Manage complications (e.g., acute renal failure, DIC)

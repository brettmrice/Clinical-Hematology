## **Overview of Hemoglobin Electrophoresis** {-}

*   **Definition:** Hemoglobin electrophoresis is an analytical technique used to separate and identify different types of hemoglobin (Hb) based on their electrical charge and migration patterns in a supporting medium when subjected to an electric field
*   **Clinical Significance:**
    *   Detection and Identification of Hemoglobin Variants: Helps identify normal (HbA, HbA2, HbF) and abnormal (HbS, HbC, HbD, HbE) hemoglobins
    *   Diagnosis of Hemoglobinopathies: Essential for diagnosing sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, and other inherited hemoglobin disorders
    *   Prenatal Screening: Can be used to screen for hemoglobinopathies in pregnant women or to diagnose affected fetuses
    *   Monitoring Transfusion Therapy: Useful for tracking changes in hemoglobin composition after blood transfusions
*   **Key Principle:** Exploits the differences in electrical charge among hemoglobin variants to separate them into distinct bands on a supporting medium

## **Components of a Hemoglobin Electrophoresis System** {-}

*   **Sample:** A hemolysate (lysed red blood cells) containing hemoglobin
*   **Supporting Medium:** A solid or semi-solid matrix that provides a surface for hemoglobin migration
    *   Common media: Cellulose acetate, agarose gel, capillary
*   **Buffer:** An electrolyte solution that provides a constant pH and ionic strength, influencing the charge and migration of hemoglobin
*   **Electrophoresis Chamber:** A device that holds the supporting medium and provides electrodes for applying the electric field
*   **Power Supply:** A device that generates and controls the electric current
*   **Stain:** A dye that binds to hemoglobin and makes the separated bands visible
*   **Densitometer:** A device that measures the optical density of the stained bands, allowing for quantification of each hemoglobin type

## **Methodologies for Hemoglobin Electrophoresis** {-}

1.  **Cellulose Acetate Electrophoresis**
    *   *Principle:* Separates hemoglobin variants on a cellulose acetate membrane at alkaline pH
    *   *Supporting Medium:* A thin, flexible cellulose acetate membrane
    *   *Buffer:* Tris-EDTA-borate (TEB) buffer (pH 8.4 - 8.6)
    *   *Procedure:*
        1.  Prepare Hemolysate: Lyse red blood cells to release hemoglobin
        2.  Saturate Membrane: Soak the cellulose acetate membrane in the buffer
        3.  Apply Sample: Apply a small amount of the hemolysate to the membrane
        4.  Electrophoresis: Place the membrane in the electrophoresis chamber, apply the electric current, and allow the hemoglobin to migrate for a specific time (typically 20-30 minutes)
        5.  Staining: Remove the membrane and stain it with Ponceau S or other suitable stain to visualize the hemoglobin bands
        6.  Destaining: Remove excess stain with a destaining solution
        7.  Interpretation: Examine the membrane visually or using densitometry to identify and quantify the hemoglobin bands
    *   *Migration Pattern (from fastest to slowest migration):*
        1.  HbA1
        2.  HbF
        3.  HbS
        4.  HbC
        5.  HbA2
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   Simple and relatively inexpensive
        *   Good resolution for common hemoglobin variants (HbA, HbS, HbC, HbF)
    *   *Limitations:*
        *   Some hemoglobins comigrate (e.g., HbS and HbD, HbC and HbE) at alkaline pH
        *   Cannot be used to detect unstable hemoglobins
        *   Lower sensitivity compared to other methods

2.  **Agarose Gel Electrophoresis**
    *   *Principle:* Separates hemoglobin variants on an agarose gel at acidic pH
    *   *Supporting Medium:* Agarose gel
    *   *Buffer:* Citrate buffer (pH 6.0 - 6.2)
    *   *Procedure:* Similar to cellulose acetate electrophoresis, but using an agarose gel as the supporting medium and an acidic buffer
    *   *Migration Pattern (from fastest to slowest migration):*
        1.  HbF
        2.  HbA
        3.  HbS
        4.  HbC
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   Can be used to confirm the identity of certain hemoglobin variants that comigrate on cellulose acetate (e.g., HbS and HbD)
    *   *Limitations:*
        *   Not as commonly used as cellulose acetate electrophoresis for routine screening
        *   Lower resolution for some hemoglobin variants

3.  **Capillary Electrophoresis (CE)**
    *   *Principle:* Separates hemoglobin variants based on their charge-to-size ratio as they migrate through a capillary tube filled with an electrolyte solution under the influence of an electric field
    *   *Procedure:*
        1.  Capillary Filling: The capillary tube is filled with an appropriate electrolyte solution
        2.  Sample Injection: A small amount of the hemolysate is injected into the capillary
        3.  Electrophoresis: An electric field is applied, causing the hemoglobin variants to migrate through the capillary
        4.  Detection: A detector at the end of the capillary measures the absorbance or fluorescence of the separated hemoglobin variants
        5.  Data Analysis: The data are analyzed by specialized software to identify and quantify the hemoglobin types
    *   *Advantages:*
        *   High resolution and sensitivity
        *   Automated and rapid
        *   Can quantify small amounts of abnormal hemoglobins
        *   Reduced manual handling
    *   *Limitations:*
        *   More expensive than cellulose acetate electrophoresis
        *   Requires specialized equipment and training

## **Common Hemoglobin Variants and their Electrophoretic Patterns** {-}

Here's a table summarizing the electrophoretic mobility of common hemoglobin variants at alkaline pH (cellulose acetate electrophoresis):

| Hemoglobin Variant | Mobility at Alkaline pH |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| HbA                | Most common, migrates normally         |
| HbF                | Migrates near HbA                       |
| HbS                | Slower than HbA but faster than HbC     |
| HbC                | Slowest migration                       |
| HbA2               | Slowest migration (same as HbC)         |
| HbD                | Migrates with HbS                       |
| HbE                | Migrates with HbC                       |

*   **Important Note:** Remember that these migration patterns are at *alkaline pH*. The order may differ at acidic pH (agarose gel electrophoresis).
